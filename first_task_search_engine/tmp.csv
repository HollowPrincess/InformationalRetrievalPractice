I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

25,5966,745.0,2008-08-08T14:05:45Z,10,Best way to abstract season/show/episode data,"<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>"

I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.</p>

<p>What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language?

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>

From these methods I can return wx.DragNone, wx.DragCopy, etc. What baffles me is that from within these methods I am not allowed to call GetData, which means I am not allowed to examine the data that the user is dragging. If I cannot see the data, how am I supposed to know whether it is OK for the user to drop here?</p>

I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>

<p>For ease of passing it around between functions, I've been passing the entire tuple as a variable called 'job'. Eventually, however, I want to get at the bits, so I've been using code like this:
(jobId, label, username) = job</p>

<p>I've realised, however, that this is a maintenance nightmare, because now I can never add new fields to the result set without breaking all of my existing code. How should I have written this?</p>

<p>Here are my two best guesses:
(jobId, label, username) = (job[0], job[1], job[2])
...but that doesn't scale nicely when you have 15...20 fields</p>

<p>or to convert the results from the SQL query to a dictionary straight away and pass that around (I don't have control over the fact that it starts life as a tuple, that's fixed for me)</p>

136,43368,4462.0,2008-09-04T08:53:58Z,11,A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?,"<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is ""zoomed in"" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p>

<p>This is all in Firefox 3.  I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p>

<p>Has anyone else encountered any bizarre behavior anything like this before?  I am at a loss.</p>

The result is <a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">BowlSK</a>.  However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Level contains:

<ul>
<li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li>
<li>all .html templates for main level pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subdirectories:

<ul>
<li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at ""index.html""<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at ""games/view-series.html""</p>

<p>It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

<p>I would like to modify this <a href=""http://wordaligned.org/articles/a-subversion-pre-commit-hook"" rel=""nofollow"">script</a> to validate that the check-in file does not have a Carriage Return in the EOL formatting. The EOL format is CR LF in Windows and LF in Unix. When a User checks-in code with the Windows format. It does not compile in Unix anymore. I know this can be done on the client side but I need to have this validation done on the server side. To achieve this, I need to do the following:</p>

<p>1) Make sure the file I check is not a binary, I dont know how to do this with svnlook, should I check the mime:type of the file? The <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.reposadmin.create.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Red Book</a> does not indicate this clearly or I must have not seen it.</p>

<p>2) I would like to run the <a href=""http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_dos2uni.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">dos2unix</a> command to validate that the file has the correct EOL format. I would compare the output of the dos2unix command against the original file. If there is a diff between both, I give an error message to the client and cancel the check-in.</p>

<p>I would like your comments/feedback on this approach.</p>

<p>Edit 1: Also tried uninstalling python2.4 and 2.5 then reinstalling 2.5, which also didn't work.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Turns out when I made AppEngine into a CVS project it didn't add the core directory into my project, so when I checked it out there literally was no module named core.exceptions. Re-downloading that folder resolved the problem.</p>

PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).

<p>I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).  Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.</p>

<p>What I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read (ideally Python, C, or C++, but anything readable will do) that does this so that I can understand what I'm meant to be doing.

177,51502,5342.0,2008-09-09T10:05:36Z,2,Improving Python readability?,"<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>

<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>

<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(id), avg(a), avg(b), avg(c), avg(d) FROM tuples;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?</p>

<p>The schema (the table holds responses to a survey):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

199,58711,745.0,2008-09-12T11:18:04Z,11,"How would you design a very ""Pythonic"" UI framework?","<p>I have been playing with the Ruby library ""shoes"". Basically you can write a GUI application in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.</p>

<p>The scope of various stuff (say, the <code>la</code> label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..</p>

<pre><code>siteroot/
	models/
	controllers/
		controller1/
		controller2/
		...
	templates/
		template1/
		template2/
		...
</code></pre>

<p>..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate (Django-style) templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps I've seen resolve template paths like this:</p>

<pre><code>path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'myPage.html')
</code></pre>

<p>...the __ file __ property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllers/controller1/, then the 'myPage.html' would resolve to that same directory -- controllers/controller1/myPage.html -- and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.</p>

<p>The solution I've hacked together feels... hacky:</p>

<pre><code>base_paths = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))
template_dir = os.path.join(base_paths[0], ""templates"")
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other (non-GAE specific) solutions I've seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight (such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly).  Django seems to have an answer for this, but I'd rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.</p>

<p>I'm assuming anything hard-coded would be non-starter, since the apps live on Google's infinite server farm.  So what's a better way?</p>

When I draw to the screen using pyglet.graphics.vertex_list or pyglet.graphics.batch objects, they are very slow (~0.1 fps) compared to plain old pyglet.graphics.draw() or just glVertex() calls, which are about 40fps for the same geometry.
In Linux the vertex_list is about the same speed as glVertex, which is disappointing, and batch methods are about twice as fast, which is a little better but not as much gain as I was hoping for.</p>

How, then, can one explain this</p>

...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):

['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
...

</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!

But is_valid() always fails on unbound forms.</p>

<p>It seems like Django's forms were designed with the use case of editing data such that an unbound form isn't really useful for anything other than displaying HTML.</p>

<p>For example, if I have:</p>

    form = MyForm()

    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
</code></pre>

<p>the first call to do_query triggers exceptions on form.cleaned_data, which is not a valid field because is_valid() has not been called. It seems like I have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
    do_query(form['start_date'].field.initial, form['end_date'].field.initial)

    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

271,78238,,2008-09-16T23:11:31Z,1,OPENGL User Interface Programming,"<p>I'm developing a graphical application to present data (not a game but a real workhorse app). It needs to be cross platform, so I have chosen:</p>

<ul>
<li>python</li>
<li>openGL (I need 3D, blending, textures etc)</li>
<li>pyopengl</li>
<li>wx/pywx - windowing, dialogs etc.</li>

<p>The last component - WX - raises the question. I can put together a very nice looking app (the prototypes look slick) - but when I need to interact with the user to ask questions, get input, I have to use WX. It makes the app look inconsistent to have traditional UI with traditional dialogs and combos and text entry on top of a full screen 3D app with blending, smooth motion, textures etc.</p>

<p>Has anyone developed a GUI using OpenGL and python? Can you share with me the toolkits and/or tricks you used? I need combos, text entry, buttons, radios, option buttons, tree view.</p>

<p>There are some toolkits out there, but they are either incomplete or old and unmaintained. A great example is pyUI (http://pyui.sourceforge.net/) - looks slick but untouched for years.</p>

  <p>In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation. This allows splitting tables with nicer effects around the split.</p>

<pre><code>('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, 'splitfirst'), colors.black) 
('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, 0), colors.black) 
('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, -1), colors.black)

Essentially, I have two classes that I'm modeling. A DownloadManager class and a DownloadThread class. The obvious OOP concept here is composition.

<p>Since this extension module invokes the Python interpreter, I need to verify that it properly manages the memory occupied by Python objects.  </p>

276,79454,10840.0,2008-09-17T02:52:58Z,5,Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?,"<p>Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).</p>

<p>I chose a mocking library called <a href=""http://labix.org/mocker"" rel=""nofollow"">mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():
    def test(config):
        ac = AppController()
        m = Mocker()
        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)
        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))
        with m:
            result = ac.current_window_controller()
            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)
    yield test, []
    yield test, [0]
    yield test, [1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:</p>

<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):
    try:
        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting
        # with the controller of the top-most window
        # assumption: the top-most window is the ""current"" one
        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return wc
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>

<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>

<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>

We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>

<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>
</ol>

<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.</p>

<p>Now, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>

<li>Check if files-to-be-monitored have been modified (possibly just if they've been saved).</li>

<li>If a test fails, but in the previous run it passed, generate a growl alert. Same with tests that fail then pass.</li>
<li>Wait, and repeat steps 2-5.</li>

<p>The problem I can see there is if the tests are in a different file. The simple solution would be to run all the tests after each save.. but with slower tests, this might take longer than the time between saves, and/or could use a lot of CPU power etc..</p>

In one class I calculate the attributes of the character. In a different class, I'm displaying to the user which specialties are available based on the attributes of the character.

<p>Here is an example of what I have:</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't figure out how to use the ""intelligence"" variable from the BasicInfoPage class to the MOS class. I've tried several different things from around the Internet but nothing seems to work. What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I realized after I posted this that I didn't explain it that well. I'm trying to create a computer version of the Twilight 2000 RPG from the 1980s.</p>

<p>I'm using wxPython to create a wizard; the parent class of my classes is the Wizard from wxPython. That wizard will walk a user through the creation of a character, so the Basic Information page (class BasicInfoPage) lets the user give the character's name and ""roll"" for the character's attributes. That's where the ""self.intelligence"" comes from.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the attributes created her for a page further on in the wizard, where the user selects the speciality of the character. The specialities that are available depend on the attributes the character has, e.g. if the intelligence is high enough, the character can be an Intel Anaylst.</p>

<p>It's been several years since I've programmed, especially with OOP ideas. That's why I'm confused on how to create what's essentially a global variable with classes and methods. </p>

certain models in the admin.  In my case if I change one object, 
certain others should be deleted as they depend upon the object's now 
out-of-date state. </p>

<p>I understand where to implement the actual cascaded updates (inside 
the parent model's save method), but I don't see a quick way to ask 
the user for confirmation (and then rollback if they decide not to 
save). I suppose I could implement some weird confirmation logic 
directly inside the save method (sort of a two phase save) but that

error types that I find extremely useful--:<code>E1101: *%s %r has no %r
member*</code>--constantly reports errors when using common django fields,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>E1101:125:get_user_tags: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member

<pre><code>def get_user_tags(username):

   Returns a query set.
   """"""
   return Tag.objects.filter(  ## This line triggers the error.

# Here is the Tag class, models.Model is provided by Django:
class Tag(models.Model):
   """"""

   """"""

<p>How can I tune Pylint to properly take fields such as objects into account?  (I've also looked into the Django source, and I have been unable to find the implementation of <code>objects</code>, so I suspect it is not ""just"" a class field.  On the other hand, I'm fairly new to python, so I may very well have overlooked something.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.

the_str = 'p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t   \n     \n\tp3'

429,118540,,2008-09-23T01:04:10Z,0,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>

<p>I am familiar with the os.name and getpass.getuser for the most general cross-platform elements.  I also have this function to generate a list of the full names of all the files in the equivalent of ~/podcasts/current:</p>

Or, can you translate my LINQ to Ruby/Python?","<p>Yesterday, I asked <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/119107/how-do-i-generate-a-list-of-n-unique-random-numbers-in-ruby"">this</a> question and never really got an answer I was really happy with. I really would like to know how to generate a list of N unique random numbers using a functional language such as Ruby without having to be extremely imperative in style.</p>

<p>Since I didn't see anything I really liked, I've written the solution I was looking for in LINQ:   </p>

<pre><code>
       static void Main(string[] args)
    	{
    		var temp = from q in GetRandomNumbers(100).Distinct().Take(5) select q;
    	}

    	private static IEnumerable GetRandomNumbers(int max)
    	{
    		Random r = new Random();
    		while (true)
    		{
    			yield return r.Next(max);
    		}
    	}
</code></pre>

<p>Can you translate my LINQ to Ruby? Python? Any other functional programming language?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please try not to use too many loops and conditionals - otherwise the solution is trivial. Also, I'd rather see a solution where you don't have to generate an array much bigger than N so you can then just remove the duplicates and trim it down to N.</p>

<p>I know I'm being picky, but I'd really like to see some elegant solutions to this problem.
Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />
Why all the downvotes? </p>

<p>Originally my code sample had the Distinct() after the Take() which, as many pointed out, could leave me with an empty list. I've changed the order in which those methods are called to reflect what I meant in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Apology:</strong><br />
I've been told this post came across as rather snobbish. I wasn't trying to imply that LINQ is better than Ruby/Python; or that my solution is much better than everyone else's. My intent is just to learn how to do this (with certain constraints) in Ruby. I'm sorry if I came across as a jerk.</p>

<p>I have Transitions in an automata. Transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. Some Transitions have a label, which encodes a certain Action that must be performed upon traversal. No label means no action. Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.</p>

<p>I need the following operations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>check if the transition has a label</li>
<li>get this label</li>
<li>add a label to a transition</li>
<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>
<li>get this condition</li>
<li>check for equality</li>
</ul>

<p>Judging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition. However, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(""foo"", Conditional(""bar"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) and Conditional(""bar"", Labeled(""foo"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:</p>

<pre><code>class Transition(object):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
    def get_label(self):
        return None
    def has_label(self):
        return False
    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):
        return decorations
    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):
        try:
            return (self.start == other.start
                    and self.end == other.end
                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)

        decorations['label'] = self.label
        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)
    def __getattr__(self, attribute):
        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)

<p>the class LabledConditionalTransition behaves exactly as expected - and having no code in there is appealing and I do not thing MI is confusing at this size.</p>

<p>Of course, the third option would be to just hammer everything into a single transition class with a bunch of in has_label/has_transition.</p>

<p>So... I am confused. Am I missing something? Which implementation looks better? How do you handle similar cases, that is, objects which look like a Decorator could handle them, but then, such a non-local method comes around?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>:
Added the ConditionalTransition-class. Basically, this kinda behaves like the decorator, minus the order created by the order of creating the decorators, the transition checks for start and end being correct, the LabeledTransition-class checks for label being correct and ConditionalTransition checks for condition being correct.</p>

<p><code>[(id\__1_, description, id\_type), (id\__2_, description, id\_type), ... , (id\__n_, description, id\_type))</code></p>

<p>The data are loaded from files that belong to the same group. In each group there could be multiples of the same id, each coming from different files. I don't care about the duplicates, so I thought that a nice way to store all of this would be to throw it into a Set type. But there's a problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes for the same id the descriptions can vary slightly, as follows:</p>

<p>IPI00110753</p>

<ul>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1A chain</li>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1 chain</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin 1</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin isotype M-alpha-1</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that this example is taken from the <a href=""http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68369"" rel=""nofollow"">uniprot protein database</a>.) </p>

<p>I don't care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.</p>

<p>I am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don't really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID's). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID's go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.</p>

<p>I have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven't thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? </p>

<p>Thank you for reading my question, <br>
Tim</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>based on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. </p>

<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?</p>

<p>*The information is a list of Swiss-Prot protein identifiers that I get by querying uniprot.</p>

<pre>
    ConfigurationName  IntDir           RootNamespace      TargetFileName
    DevEnvDir          OutDir           SafeInputName      TargetFramework
    FrameworkDir       ParentName       SafeParentName     TargetName
    FrameworkSDKDir    PlatformName     SafeRootNamespace  TargetPath
    FrameworkVersion   ProjectDir       SolutionDir        VCInstallDir
    FxCopDir           ProjectExt       SolutionExt        VSInstallDir

    InputPath          RemoteMachine    TargetExt             
</pre>

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

This is done via the RRDTool CLI from a Python script.</p>

<p>My problem is that the script is multithreaded and each thread updates the RRD at a pretty rapid pace.  Sometimes an update fails because one thread is accessing the RRD file while another one tries to access it also.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that this is OK to try since RRDTool uses its own locking mechanism, but I guess that isn't true.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good approach for concurrent access to an RRD?</p>

<p>I can think of a few ways to go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>have 1 thread create a queue and only feed the RRD from a single thread.</p></li>
<li><p>create my own locking mechanism inside the Python script. (how would I do this?)</p></li>

<p>got anything better or have you run into this issue before?</p>

The servers will communicate with each other in a cluster. Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table. The exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning, and it's important that it's possible for the person running the cluster (eg, myself) to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server.</p>

<p>Simply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.</p>

<p>What I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>

<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression. You can also concatenate multiple independent result sets together.</p>

<p>I realise this question sounds a lot like I'm asking for SQL. However, I don't want to require that the datastore backing this data be a relational database, and I don't want the overhead of trying to reimplement SQL myself. I'm also dealing with only a single table with a known schema. Finally, no joins will be required. Something much simpler would be far preferable.</p>

534,140295,5442.0,2008-09-26T15:38:00Z,2,Using locale.setlocale in embedded Python without breaking file parsing in C thread,"<p>We're using a third-party middleware product that allows us to write code in an embedded Python interpreter, and which exposes an API that we can call into. Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.</p>

<p>We've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>

<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
currentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
displayNumbersToTheUser()
locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.</p>

<p>Any information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Right now I'm using Komodo with some good success, but their vim bindings have enough little errors that I'm tired of it.</p>

<p>What I do love in Komodo, though, is the code completion. So, here's what I'm looking for (ordered by importance).</p>

<ul>
<li>Code completion, meaning: the ability to code complete modules/functions/etc. in <em>any</em> module that's on the pythonpath, <strong>not just system modules</strong>. Bonus points for showing docstrings when completing.</li>
<li>Jump-to a class definition. I'm guessing CTAGS will do this, so how do you all manage automatically updating your tags files?</li>
<li>Project type management for managing buffers: ideally the ability to grep for a filename in a directory structure to open it. Bonus for showing an index of class definitions while a buffer is open.</li>
<li>Bzr integration. Not super important, since most of it I can just drop to the shell to do.</li>

One problem that I'm running into is that significant figures don't always seem to come out properly.  For example this handles significant figures properly:</p>

<pre><code>from decimal import Decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal('1.0') + Decimal('2.0')
Decimal(""3.0"")
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal('1.00') / Decimal('3.00')
Decimal(""0.3333333333333333333333333333"")
</code></pre>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I right that this isn't the expected amount of significant digits, or do I need to brush up on significant digit math?</li>
<li>Is there any way to do this without having to set the decimal precision manually?  Granted, I'm sure I can use numpy to do this, but I just want to know if there's a way to do this with the decimal module out of curiosity.</li>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61451/does-django-have-html-helpers"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61451/does-django-have-html-helpers</a></p>

<p>My problem is this: In Django, I am constantly reproducing the basic formatting for low-level database objects. Here's an example:</p>

<p>I have two classes, Person and Address. There are multiple Addresses for each Person, setup likeso (in their respective <strong>models.py</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>class Person(models.Model):
  ...

class Address(models.Model):
  contact = models.ForeignKey(Person)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever I look at a Person, I want to see all their Addresses. So suppose <strong>Persons/views.py</strong> has something likeso:</p>

<pre><code>def detail(request, person_id):
   person = get_object_or_404( Person, pk=person_id )
   return render_to_response('persons/details.html',
      { 'title' : unicode(person), 'addresses': person.address_set.all() } )
</code></pre>

<p>And, I have a template, <strong>persons/details.html</strong>, with code, for example, like-so:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}

{% for address in addresses %}
&lt;b&gt;{{ address.name }}&lt;/b&gt;
  {{ address.type }} &lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_1 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_2 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.city }} {{ address.stateprov }} {{ address.postalcode }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.country }}
  &lt;hr&gt;
{{ endfor }}
</code></pre>

<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it's in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don't want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>

<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
{% for address in addresses %} 
  {% address.as_html4 %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
{% for address in addresses %}
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, then: Where is the best place to put the formatting? The logic?</p>

<p>Django seem to have the following (plausible) options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the formatting in models.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in views.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in some other sub-class of Person or Address (i.e.  addresses/html4.py)</p></li>
<li><p>Create custom tags</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())

    return x*y + 2*z

&gt;&gt;&gt; funny_function(""3"", 4.0, z=""5"")
22
</code></pre>

<p>Everything well so far. There is one problem, however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function g in module __main__:

g(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately, there is a workaround:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g

@args_as_ints
def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""Computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the function name and documentation are correct:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function funny_function in module __main__:

funny_function(*args, **kwargs)
    Computes x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>But there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information ""*args, **kwargs"" is next to useless.</p>

<p>What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:</p>

<p>1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>

<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):
    def g(x, y, z=3):
        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>

<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of ""*kwargs, **kwargs"" when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?</p>

<p>Any other approaches?</p>

That part works fine - I can run the Python web server application from the command line and I can have clients connect to it and get data back. At the moment, to run the web server I have to be logged in to our server as the administrator user and I have to manually start the web server. I want to have the web server automatically start on system start as a service and run in the background.</p>

<p>Using code from <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576451/"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveState</a>'s site and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how"">StackOverflow</a>, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:</p>

<pre><code>server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a ""stop"" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:</p>

<pre><code>def SvcStop(self):
    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
    exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to get called when I do ""python myservice stop"" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to ""python myservice start"" gives me an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error starting service: An instance of
  the service is already running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and subsequent calls to stop gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error stopping service: The service
  cannot accept control messages at this
  time. (1061)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.</p>

But it doesn't. Any ideas?</p>

<p>My view (for that output):</p>

    order = Product.objects.all().order_by('order')
    return render_to_response('cms/debug.html', {'order' : order, 'name' : name})

<p>And the view responsible for saving the order field:</p>

<pre><code>def manage_all(request):

if request.method == 'POST':
    PostEntries = len(request.POST)
    x = 1       
    while x &lt; PostEntries:
        p = Product.objects.get(pk=x)
        p.order = int(request.POST.get(str(x),''))
        print ""Itr: "" + str(x)
        x = x + 1
    p.save()
    print ""Product Order saved""     
    return HttpResponse(""Saved"")
</code></pre>

<p>And the model (without the boring bits):</p>

<pre><code>class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    order = models.IntegerField(blank = True, null = True
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a 'live' example of the page <a href=""http://massiveatom.com:8080/debug/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://massiveatom.com:8080/debug/</a> Please note that that is only running on the dev server, so it may not always be up.</p>

<p>I have asked in #django and they didn't seem to know what was going on. One thought was that the database/Django was being confused by the SQL command it is generating (<code>select * from table where 1 order by 'order'</code>), but I would prefer not to change the order field in the model.</p>

<p>And I know there should be back-ticks surrounding order in the above SQL command, but the syntax parsing thingy kinda hated on it...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Each object has the correct value, so I don't really know why it isn't sorting it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I don't know what was going on, but it turns out putting p.save() in the loop fixed it all...</p>

<p>Now I want to use it for Python development. From what I understand, there are two separate Python modes for Emacs: python-mode.el, which is part of the Python project; and python.el, which is part of Emacs 22.</p>

<p>I read all information I could find but most of it seems fairly outdated and I'm still confused. </p>

<p>The questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is their difference?</li>
<li>Which mode should I install and use? </li>
<li>Are there other Emacs add-ons that are essential for Python development?</li>

606,157039,2010.0,2008-10-01T10:37:20Z,13,Most pythonic way of counting matching elements in something iterable,"<p>I have an iterable of entries on which I would like to gather some simple statistics, say the count of all numbers divisible by two and the count of all numbers divisible by three.</p>

<p>My first alternative, While only iterating through the list once and avoiding the list expansion (and keeping the <a href=""http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/splitLoop.html"">split loop</a> refactoring in mind), looks rather bloated:</p>

<p>(alt 1)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

twos = 0
threes = 0

for v in r:
  if v % 2 == 0:
    twos+=1
  if v % 3 == 0:
    threes+=1

print twos
print threes
</code></pre>

<p>This looks rather nice, but has the drawback of expanding the expression to a list:</p>

<p>(alt 2)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print len([1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0])
print len([1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0])
</code></pre>

<p>What I would really like is something like a function like this:</p>

<p>(alt 3)</p>

<pre><code>def count(iterable):
  n = 0
  for i in iterable:
    n += 1
  return n

r = xrange(1, 10)

print count(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print count(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>But this looks a lot like something that could be done without a function. The final variant is this:</p>

<p>(alt 4)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print sum(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print sum(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>and while the smallest (and in my book probably the most elegant) it doesn't feel like it expresses the intent very well.</p>

<p>So, my question to you is:</p>

<p>Which alternative do you like best to gather these types of stats? Feel free to supply your own alternative if you have something better.</p>

<p>To clear up some confusion below:</p>

<ul>
<li>In reality my filter predicates are more complex than just this simple test.</li>
<li>The objects I iterate over are larger and more complex than just numbers</li>
<li>My filter functions are more different and hard to parameterize into one predicate</li>
</ul>

<p>I know I can have .after events checking once in a while; I'm asking if I can somehow have an event fired whenever the system date/time changes, either automatically (e.g. for daylight saving time) or manually.</p>

<p>MS Windows sends such events to applications and Tkinter does receive them; I know, because if I have an .after timer waiting and I set the date/time after the timer's expiration, the timer event fires instantly.</p>

When I say accurately I mean each timestamp should be accurate relative to each other (no need to sync to an atomic clock or anything like that).</p>

<p>I've been using datetime.now() as a first stab, but this isn't perfect:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,1000):
...     datetime.datetime.now()
...
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 562000)

datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 562000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 562000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>The changes between clocks for the first second of samples looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>uSecs    difference
562000  
578000  16000
609000  31000
625000  16000
640000  15000
656000  16000
687000  31000
703000  16000
718000  15000
750000  32000
765000  15000
781000  16000
796000  15000
828000  32000
843000  15000
859000  16000
890000  31000
906000  16000
921000  15000
937000  16000
968000  31000
984000  16000
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the timer data is only updated every ~15-32ms on my machine. The problem comes when we come to analyse the data because sorting by something other than the timestamp and then sorting by timestamp again can leave the data in the wrong order (chronologically). It would be nice to have the time stamps accurate to the point that any call to the time stamp generator gives a unique timestamp.</p>

<p>I had been considering some methods involving using a time.clock() call added to a starting datetime, but would appreciate a solution that would work accurately across threads on the same machine. Any suggestions would be very gratefully received.</p>

<p>The problem is with the two modules importing each other I just get an import error on which ever is being imported second :(</p>

Self is not a keyword in Python, but there is a ""self-like"" value no matter what you call it.<br />
Python methods receive self as an explicit argument, whereas Ruby does not.<br />

I will try to explain this with an example:</p>

<pre><code>class Project(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
  employees = models.ManyToManyField(Profile, limit_choices_to={'active': '1'})

class TimeWorked(models.Model):
  project = models.ForeignKey(Project, limit_choices_to={'user': user})
  hours = models.PositiveIntegerField()

<p>Of course that code doesn't work because there is no 'user' object, but that was my idea and I was trying to send the object 'user' to the model to just limit the choices where the current user has projects, I don't want to see projects where I'm not in.</p>

<p>In Python, it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/773/how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby"">how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Car(models.Model):
    mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Mods(models.Model):
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>How does one get a list of Cars, grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p>

<p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p>

<pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ 
  { mods: { 'a' }, cars: { 'W1', 'W2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b' }, cars: { 'X1', 'X2', 'X3' }, },
  { mods: { 'b' }, cars: { 'Y1', 'Y2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b', 'c' }, cars: { 'Z1' } },
]
</code></pre>

<p>I've been thinking of something like:</p>

<pre><code>def cars_by_common_mods():
  cars = Cars.objects.all()

  mod_list = []      

  for car in cars:
    mod_list.append( { 'car': car, 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } 

  ret = []

  for key, mods_group in groupby(list(mods), lambda x: set(x.mods)):
    ret.append(mods_group)

  return ret
</code></pre>

<p>However, that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say, I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating.</p>

The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.</p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>

<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>

<p>$ git clone [repository url]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...</p>

<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>

<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>

<p>I have to get all href tags, their corresponding text and some other text based on a different regex.
So I have 3 expressions and would like to tokenize the line and extract tokens of text matching every expression.</p>

an elegant way to do this by executing ""actions"" based on expressions. One can control the way

<p>This all works just fine for small workloads.  However, I recently used <code>urllib2</code> to write a stress-testing script that would simulate a workload of 100 clients.  After some time, each client gets a 503 error from Apache, indicating that Apache cannot connect to <code>127.0.0.1:4321</code>.

<p>Googling for this error reveals that Apache has probably run out of socket file descriptors.  Since I only have 100 clients running, this implies that the connections are not being closed, either between my <code>urllib2</code> connection and Apache (I am definitely calling <code>.close()</code> on the return value of <code>urlopen</code>), or between Apache and CherryPy.</p>

Can you elaborate on the best-practices of naming attributes with a single or double leading underscore ? I see in most modules that a single underscore is used.</p>

At the time, the best solution I could find uses ping (I kid you not) to achieve the desired effect. I've found a better write-up of it <a href=""http://malektips.com/dos0017.html"">here</a>, which describes a callable ""wait.bat"", implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@ping 127.0.0.1 -n 2 -w 1000 &gt; nul
@ping 127.0.0.1 -n %1% -w 1000&gt; nul
</code></pre>

<p>You can then include calls to wait.bat in your own batch file, passing in the number of seconds to sleep.</p>

<p><a href=""http://malektips.com/xp_dos_0002.html"">Apparently the Windows 2003 Resource Kit provides a Unix-like sleep command</a> (at last!). In the meantime, for those of us still using Windows&nbsp;XP, Windows 2000 or (sadly) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT"">Windows NT</a>, is there a better way?</p>

<p>I modified the <code>sleep.py</code> script in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166044/sleeping-in-a-dos-batch-file#166290"">accepted answer</a>, so that it defaults to one second if no arguments are passed on the command line:</p>

<p>Ideally I'd want to capture all output (not just errors) and log it to a file. Any unhandled exceptions ought to log to the current file and then allow the exception to pass on as per usual (i.e. the logging process ought to be transparent).</p>

<p>My problem is that after I log in, I will still randomly get the log in screen now and again. It seems to me that each apache process has it's own python process, which in turn has it's own internals. So as long as I get served by the same process I logged in to, everything is fine and dandy. But if my request gets served by a different apache process, I am no longer authenticated.</p>

<p>Is this a known issue and are there workarounds/fixes?</p>

This is because they are too behind the authenticating middleware, so they will randomly put up a login image.

Is there some way to get CherryPy to initialize its session object immediately instead of on the first page request?</p>

<p>I have two ugly alternatives if the answer is no:</p>

<p>Say you have a system of nodes communicating with each other on a network via asynchronous messages. The nodes do not maintain session information about other nodes (this is a design restriction).</p>

<p>Say you want to make sure only your nodes can read the messages being sent. I believe encryption is the sollution to that.</p>

<p>Since the nodes are not maintaining a session and communication must work in a stateless, connectionless fashion, I am guessing that asymmetric encryption is ruled out.</p>

<p>So here is what I would like to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>messages are sent as UDP datagrams</li>
<li>each message contains a timestamp to make messages differ (counter replay attacks)</li>
<li>each message is encrypted with a shared secret symmetric key and sent over the network</li>
<li>other end can decrypt with shared secret symmetric key</li>
</ul>

<p>Keys can obviously be compromised by compromising any single node. At the same time, in this scenario, access to any single compromised node reveals all interesting information anyway, so the key is not the weakest link.</p>

<p>What cypher should I use for this encryption? What key length?</p>

<p>I would prefer to use something supported by <a href=""http://www.freenet.org.nz/ezPyCrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">ezPyCrypto</a>.</p>

<p>There seems to be two immediate approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>write an efficient system, attaching a unique id to each multicasted message,
having the sequencer multicast sequence numbers for the message id's it receives,
and sending back and forth ACK's and NACK's.</li>
<li>write an inefficient flooding system, where each multicaster simply re-sends each
message it receives once (unless it was sent by that particular multicaster.)</li>

<p>I'm currently multicasting UDP messages (which seems to be the only option,) but that means that some messages might get lost. That means I have to be able to uniquely identify each sent UDP message, so that it can be re-sent according to #2.

<p>So, because it's so easy to immediately see the output of your program and any errors that may occur, I haven't uses a debugger tool yet. What situations may call for using a real debugger vs. the method I currently use?</p>

<p>I'd like to know before I get into a situation and get frustrated because I don't know how to fix the problem.</p>

Here are my assumptions - I think they're similar for alot of people right now:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is now October 2008.  I want to start writing an application for January 2009.  I am willing to use beta code and such but by January, I'd like a site that doesn't have 'strange' problems.  With that said, if a language is simply 10% slower than another, I don't care about those things as long as the issue is linear.  My main concern is developer productivity.</li>
<li>I'll be using Linux, Apache, MySQL for the application.</li>
<li>I want the power to do things like run scp and ftp client functions with stable libraries (I only picked those two because they're not web-related but at the same time represent pretty common network protocols that any larger app might use).  Technologies like OpenID and Oauth will be used as well.</li>
<li>Experienced web developers are readily available (i.e. I don't have to find people from financial companies and such).</li>
<li>Whatever the choice is is common and will be around for a while.</li>
<li>Here's a kicker.  I'd like to be able to use advanced presentation layer tools/languages similar to HAML, SASS.  I definitively want to use JQuery.</li>
<li>I will be creating a Facebook app and at some point doing things like dealing with SMS messages, iPhone apps, etc...</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, the choices for language are PHP (Cake,Symfony,Zend), Python (Django), Ruby (Merb).  I'm really between Django and Merb at this point mostly because everybody else seems to be going that way.  </p>

<p>Please don't put any technologies in here that aren't made for mainstream.  I know Merb is untested mostly, but their stated goal is a solid platform and it has alot of momentum behind it so I'm confident that it's workable.  Please don't answer with how great Perl is or .Net.</p>

<p>For Future References - these choices were already made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debian (Lenny) - For converting CPU cycles into something useful. Trac</li>
<li>0.11 - For Project Management Gliffy - For wireframes and such </li>
<li>Google Docs/Apps - For documentation, hosted email, etc... </li>

Until now, I've been ... ahem ... keeping multiple copies of the common code and synchronizing by hand. But I'd clearly prefer to do something else.</p>

<p>It looks to me now, as if zc.Buildout maybe what I need. I guess that what I should be doing is putting each reusable component of my system into a separate egg, and then using buildout to assemble them into projects.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking that for any particular module, I should put the unit-tests into a separate package or egg, so that I'm not also installing copies of the component's  unit-tests in every project. I only want to unit-test in a place where my library is developed, not where it's just being used.</p>

<p>So maybe I want something like this</p>

<pre><code>projects
  lib1
    tests
    code
  lib2
    tests
    code
  app1
    tests 
    appcode
  app2
    tests
    appcode

<p>Where both app1 and app2 are independent applications with their own code and tests, but are also including and using both lib1 and lib2. And lib1/test, lib1/code, lib2/test, lib2code, app1, app2 are separate eggs. Does this sound right?</p>

<p>However, I now get confused. I assume that when I develop app1, I want buildout to pull copies of lib1, lib2 and app1 into a separate working directory rather than put copies of these libraries under app1 directly. But how does this work with my SVN source-control? If the working directory is dynamically constructed with buildout, it can't be a live SVN directory from which I can check the changes back into the repository?</p>

<p>Have I misunderstood how buildout is meant to be used? Would I be better going for a completely different approach? How do you mix source-control with module-reuse between projects?</p>

<p>Update : thanks to the two people who've currently answered this question. I'm experimenting more with this.</p>

<pre><code>print ""Hi!  I'm %(name)s, and I'm %(age)d years old."" % ({""name"":""Brian"",""age"":30})
</code></pre>

<p>What's the closest, simplest Ruby idiom to replicate this behavior?  (No monkeypatching the String class, please.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> One of the really excellent benefits of this is that you can store the pre-processed string in a variable and use it as a ""template"", like so:</p>

<pre><code>template = ""Hi!  I'm %(name)s, and I'm %(age)d years old.""
def greet(template,name,age):
    print template % ({""name"":name,""age"":age})

<p>This is obviously a trivial example, but there is a lot of utility in being able to store such a string for later use.  Ruby's <code>""Hi!  I'm #{name}""</code> convention is cursorily similar, but the immediate evaluation makes it less versatile.</p>

<p>then it works, so I know that it can retrieve the site.  No other program is connected to Oracle, so it's not like there are two developers stepping on each other somehow.  I assume that some sort of table lock hasn't been released.</p>

<p>So short of shutting down the Oracle database and bringing it back up, how do I release that lock or whatever is blocking me?  I'd like to not resort to a database shutdown because in the future that may be disruptive to some of the other developers.</p>

<p>The <code>DBA_WAITERS</code> table has 182 entries with lock type ""DML"".  The <code>DBA_BLOCKERS</code> table has 14 entries whose session ids all correspond to the username used by our application code.</p>

I'm a real novice when it comes to Oracle administration and have mostly just used MySQL in the past, so I'm definitely out of my element.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: It turns out that despite what I thought, another programmer was indeed accessing the database at the same time as me.  So what's the best way to detect this in the future?  Perhaps I should have shut down my program and then queried the <code>DBA_WAITERS</code> and <code>DBA_BLOCKERS</code> tables to make sure they were empty.</p>

835,207290,13871.0,2008-10-16T03:02:27Z,1,extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string,"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>

&lt;div id=""Testing""&gt;
{{thebest}}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>Here's the script in scripts.js:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(""#SubmitForm"").click(submitMe);

var submitMe = function(){
    //alert('no way');
    var f = $('#SubmitForm');
    var action = f.attr(""action"");
    var serializedForm = f.serialize();
  $.ajax( {
        type: 'post',
        data: serializedForm,
        url:  form_action,
        success: function( result ) {
          $('#SubmitForm').after( ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;"" +
                                     result +

        }
      } );

    };

<p>But, the completion only seems to work at the beginning of strings.  If you want to match the middle or end of a string readline doesn't work.</p>

<p>I would like to autocomplete strings, in a command-line python program by matching what I type with any of the strings in a list of available strings.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A good example of the type of autocompletion I would like to have is the type that happens in GMail when you type in the To field.  If you type one of your contacts' last name, it will come up just as well as if you typed her first name.  </li>
<li>Some use of the up and down arrows or some other method to select from the matched strings may be needed (and not needed in the case of readline) and that is fine in my case.</li>
<li>My particular use case is a command-line program that sends emails.</li>
<li>Specific code examples would be very helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using terminal emulators like curses would be fine.  It only has to run on linux, not Mac or Windows.</p>

<p>Here is an example:
Say I have the following three strings in a list </p>

<pre><code>['Paul Eden &lt;paul@domain.com&gt;', 
'Eden Jones &lt;ejones@domain.com&gt;', 
'Somebody Else &lt;somebody@domain.com&gt;']

<p>I would like some code that will autocomplete the first two items in the list after I type 'Eden' and then allow me to pick one of them (all through the command-line using the keyboard).</p>

<p>I found the functions bisect_left/right in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html"">bisect module</a>, but they still return a position even if the item is not in the list. That's perfectly fine for their intended usage, but I just want to know if an item is in the list or not (don't want to insert anything).</p>

<p>I thought of using <code>bisect_left</code> and then checking if the item at that position is equal to what I'm searching, but that seems cumbersome (and I also need to do bounds checking if the number can be larger than the largest number in my list). If there is a nicer method I'd like to know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> To clarify what I need this for: I'm aware that a dictionary would be very well suited for this, but I'm trying to keep the memory consumption as low as possible. My intended usage would be a sort of double-way look-up table. I have in the table a list of values and I need to be able to access the values based on their index.

<p>Using a dictionary for this would be the fastest way, but would (approximately) double the memory requirements.</p>

from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

class Animal(models.Model):
  content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType,editable=False,null=True)
  name = models.CharField()

class Dog(Animal):
  is_lucky = models.BooleanField()

class Cat(Animal):
  lives_left = models.IntegerField()
</code></pre>

<p>And an <em>animals/urls.py</em>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.conf.urls.default import *

from animals.models import Animal, Dog, Cat

dict = { 'model' : Animal }

urlpatterns = (
  url(r'^edit/(?P&lt;object_id&gt;\d+)$', 'create_update.update_object', dict),
)
</code></pre>

<p>How can one use generic views to edit Dog and/or Cat using the same form?</p>

<p>I.e. The <em>form</em> object that is passed to *animals/animal_form.html* will be Animal, and thus won't contain any of the specifics for the derived classes Dog and Cat. How could I have Django automatically pass a form for the child class to *animal/animals_form.html*?</p>

<p>Incidentally, I'm using <a href=""http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1031/"" rel=""nofollow"">Djangosnippets #1031</a> for ContentType management, so Animal would have a method named *as_leaf_class* that returns the derived class.</p>

<p>Clearly, one could create forms for each derived class, but that's quite a lot of unnecessary duplication (as the templates will all be generic -- essentially {{ form.as_p }}).</p>

<p>Incidentally, it's best to assume that Animal will probably be one of several unrelated base classes with the same problem, so an ideal solution would be generic.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for the help.</p>

I want it to be multithreaded because I want to have an in memory object cache that will be used by various http threads. My webserver does a lot of expensive stuff and computes some large arrays which needs to be cached in memory for future use to avoid recomputing. This is not possible in a multi-process web server environment. Storing this information in memcache is also not a good idea as the arrays are large and storing them in memcache would lead to deserialization of data coming from memcache apart from the additional overhead of IPC.</p>

<p>I implemented a simple webserver using BaseHttpServer, it gives good performance but it gets stuck after a few hours time. I need some more matured webserver. Is it possible to configure apache to use mod_python under a thread model so that I can do some object caching?</p>

Suppose the C program reads some bytes from a file into a char array and learns (somehow) that the bytes represent text with a certain encoding (e.g., ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252, or UTF-8).  How do I decode the contents of this char array into a Python string?</p>

<p>The Python string should in general be of type <code>unicode</code>âfor instance, a <code>0x93</code> in Windows-1252 encoded input becomes a <code>u'\u0201c'</code>.</p>

<p>I have attempted to use <code>PyString_Decode</code>, but it always fails when there are non-ASCII characters in the string.  Here is an example that fails:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
     char c_string[] = { (char)0x93, 0 };
     PyObject *py_string;

     Py_Initialize();

     py_string = PyString_Decode(c_string, 1, ""windows_1252"", ""replace"");
     if (!py_string) {
          PyErr_Print();
          return 1;
     }
     return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is <code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u201c' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</code>, which indicates that the <code>ascii</code> encoding is used even though we specify <code>windows_1252</code> in the call to <code>PyString_Decode</code>.</p>

<p>The following code works around the problem by using <code>PyString_FromString</code> to create a Python string of the undecoded bytes, then calling its <code>decode</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
     char c_string[] = { (char)0x93, 0 };
     PyObject *raw, *decoded;

     Py_Initialize();

     raw = PyString_FromString(c_string);
     printf(""Undecoded: "");
     PyObject_Print(raw, stdout, 0);
     printf(""\n"");
     decoded = PyObject_CallMethod(raw, ""decode"", ""s"", ""windows_1252"");
     Py_DECREF(raw);
     printf(""Decoded: "");
     PyObject_Print(decoded, stdout, 0);
     printf(""\n"");

<p>I thought wow, this will be easy because the data is in the column below type=body.  Counting down I knew that in the data rows I would need to get the values in columns [3, 7, 11, 15].  So I set out to accomplish that using this code:</p>

<pre><code>indexComment = souptoGetColIndex.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))
indexRow=indexComment[0].findParent()
indexCells=indexRow.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))

<p>what I got back was collist=[0, 3, 7, 7, 15]</p>

<p>It turns out I think that because cells in the 7th and 11th position looked exactly alike the same index position was returned.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with this, clearly I had to make them look different.  So what I did was make them look different by first using a readlines to read each line of the file in and change the blank spaces to a random integer.</p>

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(random.randint(1,14567))))

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(toGetColIndex.index(each))))
</code></pre>

<p>Nonetheless, each of these approaches gets me a list with the colindex for the location of my headers for each column and to use on the data rows.  Note that replace function is missing the blank space since I guess the html is causing it to disappear the actual code uses r""&amp;.n.b.s.p;"" without the periods</p>

<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>
<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>
<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>

<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.

At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>

<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>

I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.</p>

<p>Should I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)? Perhaps that is what I'm missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p>

How much different do they tend to be from their production equivalents?</p>

<p>I haven't quite decided which framework to go with, much less what production server to use, so it's kinda difficult for me to pin this down to a ""compare development server x to production server y.""  So with that said, let me make the question a little bit more precise:  In your past experience with a python framework, how much time did you have to spend getting your application up and running with a production system once its been developed on a development server?  Or did you skip the development server and develop your app on a server that's more like what you will use in production?</p>

<p>When I type shift-3 in the Python interactive shell, I seem to invoke the previous word function, i.e. the cursor will move to the start of the last âwordâ (i.e. space-delimited item) typed on the line. When Iâm back in the bash shell, typing shift-3 just produces a Â£, as expected.</p>

<p>This version of Python apparently uses editline for its interactive shell, as opposed to readline. Iâm guessing that one of the default editline key bindings binds shift-3 (or whatever editline sees when I type shift-3) to the ed-prev-word command.</p>

<p>Iâve tried a few things in my ~/.editrc file to remove this binding, and they donât have any effect:</p>

When I try to run the application, I get an error message that just says ""see the logfile for details"". The only problem is, the log file is empty. </p>

<p>The closest error I've seen is ""The following modules appear to be missing"" but I'm not using any of those modules as far as I know (especially since they seem to be of databases I'm not using) but digging up on Google suggests that these are relatively benign warnings.</p>

<p>I've written and packaged a console application as well as a wxpython one with py2exe and both applications have compiled and run successfully. I am using a new python toolkit called dabo, which in turn makes uses of wxpython modules so I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Where do I start investigating the problem since obviously the log file hasn't been too useful?   </p>

<p><b>Edit 1:</b> 
The python version is 2.5. py2exe is 0.6.8. There were no significant build errors. The only one was the bit about ""The following modules appear to be missing..."" which were non critical errors since the packages listed were ones I was definitely not using and shouldn't stop the execution of the app either. Running the executable produced a logfile which was completely empty. Previously it had an error about locales which I've since fixed but clearly something is wrong as the executable wasn't running. The setup.py file is based quite heavily on the original setup.py generated by running their ""app wizard"" and looking at the example that Ed Leafe and some others posted. Yes, I have a log file and it's not printing anything for me to use, which is why I'm asking if there's any other troubleshooting avenue I've missed which will help me find out what's going on. </p>

<p>I have even written a bare bones test application which simply produces a bare bones GUI - an empty frame with some default menu options. The code written itself is only 3 lines and the rest is in the 3rd party toolkit. Again, that compiled into an exe (as did my original app) but simply did not run. There were no error output in the run time log file either. </p>

<p>I think it should be possible, PySmell's <code>idehelper.py</code> does a majority of the complex stuff, it should just be a case of giving it the current line, offering up the completions (the bit I am not sure about) and then replacing the line with the selected one.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import idehelper
&gt;&gt;&gt; # The path is where my PYSMELLTAGS file is located:
&gt;&gt;&gt; PYSMELLDICT = idehelper.findPYSMELLDICT(""/Users/dbr/Desktop/pysmell/"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = idehelper.detectCompletionType("""", """" 1, 2, """", PYSMELLDICT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; completions = idehelper.findCompletions(""proc"", PYSMELLDICT, options)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print completions
[{'dup': '1', 'menu': 'pysmell.pysmell', 'kind': 'f', 'word': 'process', 'abbr': 'process(argList, excluded, output, verbose=False)'}]
</code></pre>

<p>It'll never be perfect, but it would be extremely useful (even if just for completing the stdlib modules, which should never change, so you wont have to constantly regenerate the PYSMELLTAGS file whenever you add a function)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Progressing! I have the utter-basics of completion in place - barely works, but it's close..</p>

<p>I ran <code>python pysmells.py /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/*.py -O /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/pysmell/PYSMELLTAGS</code></p>

<p>Place the following in a TextMate bundle script, set ""input: entire document"", ""output: insert as text"", ""activation: key equivalent: alt+esc"", ""scope selector: source.python""</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import sys
from pysmell import idehelper

CUR_WORD = os.environ.get(""TM_CURRENT_WORD"")

cur_file = os.environ.get(""TM_FILEPATH"")
orig_source = sys.stdin.read()
line_no = int(os.environ.get(""TM_LINE_NUMBER""))
cur_col = int(os.environ.get(""TM_LINE_INDEX""))

# PYSMELLS is currently in site-packages/pysmell/
PYSMELLDICT = idehelper.findPYSMELLDICT(""/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/pysmell/blah"")
options = idehelper.detectCompletionType(cur_file, orig_source, line_no, cur_col, """", PYSMELLDICT)
completions = idehelper.findCompletions(CUR_WORD, PYSMELLDICT, options)

if len(completions) &gt; 0:
    new_word = completions[0]['word']
    new_word = new_word.replace(CUR_WORD, """", 1) # remove what user has already typed
    print new_word
</code></pre>

<p>Then I made a new python document, typed ""import urll"" and hit alt+escape, and it completed it to ""import urllib""!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I tried to figure out what was happening. My application does not open any file or any socket etc. My file only opens couple of berkeley dbs. I investigated this issue further. I saw the file descriptors used by my cherrypy process with id 4536  in /proc/4536/fd/
Initially there were new sockets created and cleaned up properly but after an hour I found that it had about 509 sockets that were not cleaned. All the sockets were in CLOSE_WAIT state. I got this information using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>netstat -ap | grep ""4536"" | grep CLOSE_WAIT | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>CLOSE_WAIT state means that the remote client has closed the connection. Why is cherrypy then not closing the socket and free the file descriptors? What can I do to resolve the problem? </p>

<p>I tried to play with the following:</p>

<pre><code>cherrypy.config.update({'server.socketQueueSize': '10'})
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that this would restrict the number of sockets open at any time to 10 but it was not effective at all. This is the only config I have set, so , rest of the configs hold their default values.</p>

<p>Could somebody throw light on this? Do you think its a bug in cherrypy? How can I resolve it? Is there a way I can close these sockets myself?</p>

d.something = 'one'

<p>I find it more aesthetically pleasing than <code>d['something']</code>. Note that accessing an undefined key returns None instead of raising an exception, which is also nice.</p>

<p>Update: Smashery makes a good point, which mhawke expands on for an easier solution. I'm wondering if there are any undesirable side effects of using <strong>dict</strong> instead of defining a new dictionary; if not, I like mhawke's solution a lot.</p>

932,224735,14351.0,2008-10-22T07:16:23Z,6,Open Source Profiling Frameworks?,"<p>Have you ever wanted to test and quantitatively show whether your application would perform better as a static build or shared build, stripped or non-stripped, upx or no upx, gcc -O2 or gcc -O3, hash or btree, etc etc. If so this is the thread for you. There are hundreds of ways to tune an application, but how do we collect, organize, process, visualize the consequences of each experiment. </p>

<p>I have been looking for several months for an open source application performance engineering/profiling framework similar in concept to Mozilla's <a href=""http://graphs.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Perftastic</a> where I can develop/build/test/profile hundreds of incarnations of different tuning experiments. </p>

<p>Some requirements:</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>SUSE32 and SUSE64</p>

<h2>Data Format</h2>

<p>Very flexible, compact, simple, hierarchical. There are several possibilities including</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"" rel=""nofollow"">CSV</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool"" rel=""nofollow"">RRD</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_buffers"" rel=""nofollow"">Protocol Buffers</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON</a></li>
<li>No XML. There is lots of data and XML is tooo verbose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Acquisition</h2>

<p>Flexible and Customizable plugins. There is lots of data to collect from the application including performance data from /proc, sys time, wall time, cpu utilization, memory profile, leaks, valgrind logs, arena fragmentation, I/O, localhost sockets, binary size, open fds, etc. And some from the host system. My language of choice for this is Python, and I would develop these plugins to monitor and/or parse data in all different formats and store them in the data format of the framework.</p>

<h2>Tagging</h2>

<p>All experiments would be tagged including data like GCC version and compile options, platform, host, app options, experiment, build tag, etc.</p>

<h2>Graphing</h2>

<p>History, Comparative, Hierarchical, Dynamic and Static.</p>

<ul>
<li>The application builds are done by a custom CI sever which releases a new app version several times per day the last 3 years straight. This is why we need a continuous trend analysis. When we add new features, make bug fixes, change build options, we want to automatically gather profiling data and see the trend. This is where generating various static builds is needed. </li>
<li>For analysis <a href=""http://graphs.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla dynamic graphs</a> are great for doing comparative graphing. It would be great to have comparative graphing between different tags. For example compare N build versions, compare platforms, compare build options, etc. </li>
<li>We have a test suite of 3K tests, data will be gathered per test, and grouped from inter-test data, to per test, to per tagged group, to complete regression suite. </li>
<li>Possibilities include <a href=""http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/index.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RRDTool</a>, <a href=""http://www.orcaware.com/orca/example_sites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Orca</a>, <a href=""http://graphite.wikidot.com/screen-shots"" rel=""nofollow"">Graphite</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis on a grouping basis</h2>

<ul>
<li>Min</li>
<li>Max</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Avg</li>
<li>Standard Deviation</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>All of this would be presented and controlled through a app server, preferably Django or TG would be best.</p>

<p>Basically: is there any Continuous Integration systems aimed at python, that produce lots of shiny graphs and the likes?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this time the Jenkins project has replaced Hudson as the community version of the package. The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org"">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I'll stick with Hudson. <a href=""http://integrityapp.com/"">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=""http://buildbot.net/trac"">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>

<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download Hudson from <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>
<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>
<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click ""Update"" or similar</li>
<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>
<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>
<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it's not already</li>
<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>
<li>Check ""Publish JUnit test result report"" and set ""Test report XMLs"" to <code>**/nosetests.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That's all that's required. You can setup email notifications, and <a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins"">the plugins</a> are worth a look. A few I'm currently using for Python projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/SLOCCount+Plugin"">SLOCCount plugin</a> to count lines of code (and graph it!) - you need to install <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/"">sloccount</a> separately</li>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations"">Violations</a> to parse the PyLint output (you can setup warning thresholds, graph the number of violations over each build)</li>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Cobertura+Plugin"">Cobertura</a> can parse the coverage.py output. Nosetest can gather coverage while running your tests, using <code>nosetests --with-coverage</code> (this writes the output to <code>**/coverage.xml</code>)</li>

<p>Here is an (overcomplicated?) example.  If people have a simpler one that demos it, I'd like to hear it.   The issue:  the list comprehensions using next() are filled with the result from the last iteration.  </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: The Problem:</p>

<p>What exactly is going on with this, and how do I fix this?  Do I have to use a standard for loop? Clearly the function is running the correct number of times, but the list comprehensions end up with the <em>final</em> value instead of the result of each loop.</p>

However I've come upon some.. negativity in relation to fine-grained control of permissions to the CRUD interface.</p>

<p>What I'm writing is an Intranet client management web-app. The organisation is about 6 tiers, and I need to restrict access to client groups based on tiers. Continually expanding. I have a fairly good idea how I'm going to do this, but am not sure if I'll be able to integrate it well into the pre-built admin interface. </p>

<p>I've done absolutely zero Django development otherwise I'd probably have a better idea on whether this would work or not. I probably won't use Django if the generated admin interface is going to be useless to this project - but like I said, there is a heavy reliance on fine-grained custom permissions.</p>

<p>Will Django let me build custom permissions/rules and integrate it seamlessly into the admin CRUD interface?</p>

<p>Update One: I want to use the admin app to minimise the repitition of generating CRUD interfaces, so yes I consider it a must have.</p>

<p>Update Two:</p>

<p>I want to describe the permissions required for this project.</p>

<p>A client can belong to one or many 'stores'. Full time employees should only be able to edit clients at their store (even if they belong to another store). However, they should not be able to see/edit clients at another store. Casuals should only be able to view clients based on what store they are rostered too (or if the casual is logged in as the store user - more likely).</p>

<p>Management above them need to be able to see all employees for the stores they manage, nothing more.</p>

<p>Senior management should be able to edit ALL employees and grant permissions below themselves.</p>

<p>After reading the django documentation, it says you can't (autmoatically) set permissions for a sub-set of a group. Only the entire group. Is it easy enough to mock up your own permissions for this purpose?</p>

<p>How would you refactor this so it's more dynamic?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I guess what I want to do is something like this:
Have a tuple (like the one I commented out) and iterate over it 3 times, each time making a new value (for each skill) based on the modifier for each particular range. The resulting value is then automatically assigned to it's respective variable.</p>

<p>In my head, it makes sense. But when I actually try to code it, I get lost. The problem, I think, is that this is the first ""real"" program I've written; all I've done before are small scripts.</p>

<p>This is only the 0.1 version of my program, so it's not critical to refactor it now. However, it seems very un-Pythonic to do this manually and I also want to ""future-proof"" this in case things change down the road.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>This question is similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code</a></p>

<p>The differences being:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to add the revision number to Python</p></li>
<li><p>I want the revision of the repository (not the checked out file)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I.e. I would like to extract the Revision number from the return from 'svn info', likeso:</p>

<p>$ svn info</p>

<pre><code>Path: .
URL: svn://localhost/B/trunk
Repository Root: svn://localhost/B
Revision: 375
Node Kind: directory
Schedule: normal
Last Changed Author: bmh
Last Changed Rev: 375
Last Changed Date: 2008-10-27 12:09:00 -0400 (Mon, 27 Oct 2008)
</code></pre>

<p>I want a variable with 375 (the Revision). It's easy enough with put $Rev$ into a variable to keep track of changes on a file. However, I would like to keep track of the repository's version, and I understand (and it seems based on my tests) that $Rev$ only updates when the file changes.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts turn to using the svn/libsvn module built in to Python, though I can't find any documentation on or examples of how to use them.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I've thought calling 'svn info' and regex'ing the code out, though that seems rather brutal. :)</p>

<p>Help would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Cheers.</p>

<p>The problem is I did not find the counterpart to the <strong>syms</strong> function, and the symbolic toolbox in general. (I'd like a port of the <em>Control System Toolbox</em> too, amd I'm still searching for some functions I'd may need).</p>

<p>The only thing about symbolic toolbox I've found is <a href=""http://www.cert.fr/dcsd/idco/perso/Magni/s_sym/doc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, but it was a little trcky and not so easy (actually I was not able to set up it correctly in 30&nbsp;minutes, and I gave up for now. I'm going to try later), and it needs Maxima to be installed. Does anyone know anything about that?</p>

<p>Scilab is not exactly a must. The project aims to give a more <em>free</em> and <em>open source</em> alternative to MATLAB. I saw there is <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/sympy/"" rel=""nofollow"">SymPy</a> for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Python</a>, and I just could use it with <a href=""http://www.scipy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SciPy</a>, but I'd lost the <a href=""http://ralyx.inria.fr/2004/Raweb/scilab/uid96.html"" rel=""nofollow"">conversion toolbox</a> thing :\</p>

<p>That said, what should be better? Get SciLab and Maxima work together or move to Python &amp; co.? This is the start of the project, so the earlier I choose this, the better.</p>

They're especially useful when setting up chains of operations to perform on a big pile of data--I often use them when processing DSV files.</p>

<p><strong>So when is it <em>not</em> a good time to use a generator, or a generator expression, or an <code>itertools</code> function?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When should I prefer <code>zip()</code> over <code>itertools.izip()</code>, or</li>
<li><code>range()</code> over <code>xrange()</code>, or</li>
<li><code>[x for x in foo]</code> over <code>(x for x in foo)</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, we eventually need to ""resolve"" a generator into actual data, usually by creating a list or iterating over it with a non-generator loop. Sometimes we just need to know the length. This isn't what I'm asking.</p>

<p>We use generators so that we're not assigning new lists into memory for interim data. This especially makes sense for large datasets. Does it make sense for small datasets too? Is there a noticeable memory/cpu trade-off?</p>

<p>I'm especially interested if anyone has done some profiling on this, in light of the eye-opening discussion of <a href=""http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/76267"">list comprehension performance vs. map() and filter()</a>.

The problem came with a natural recursive solution. Now it happens that, even for relatively small input, the sequences are several thousands, thus I would prefer to use my algorithm as a generator instead of using it to fill a list with all the sequences.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Suppose we want to compute all the permutations of a string with a recursive function. The following naive algorithm takes an extra argument 'storage' and appends a permutation to it whenever it finds one:</p>

<pre><code>def getPermutations(string, storage, prefix=""""):
   if len(string) == 1:
      storage.append(prefix + string)   # &lt;-----
   else:
      for i in range(len(string)):
         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], storage, prefix+string[i])

storage = []
getPermutations(""abcd"", storage)
for permutation in storage: print permutation
</code></pre>

<p>(Please don't care about inefficiency, this is only an example.)</p>

<p>Now I want to turn my function into a generator, i.e. to yield a permutation instead of appending it to the storage list:</p>

<pre><code>def getPermutations(string, prefix=""""):
   if len(string) == 1:
      yield prefix + string             # &lt;-----
   else:
      for i in range(len(string)):
         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], prefix+string[i])

for permutation in getPermutations(""abcd""):
   print permutation
</code></pre>

<p>This code does <em>not</em> work (the function behaves like an empty generator).</p>

<p>Am I missing something?
Is there a way to turn the above recursive algorithm into a generator <em>without replacing it with an iterative one</em>?</p>

We use C# and ASP.NET for basically all of our development. 80% or more of our projects are web applications. It seems natural that we would look at some of the nice dynamic web languages (Ruby, Python, etc), and with things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironruby"" rel=""nofollow"">IronRuby</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironpython"" rel=""nofollow"">IronPython</a>, I started seriously investigating.</p>

<p>I love Python. It's a beautiful, expressive language. It's a joy to code in, for sure. The multitude of python modules and frameworks make it very appealing. Problem is, I cannot think of any specific problems, any specific hurdles that would <b>require</b> a language like Python. ASP.NET gives us RAD, it gives us a full-featured framework and all that good stuff. Also, we all already know C# and have lots of projects in C#, learning a new language just <i>because</i> doesn't quite work. </p>

<p>Can you guys help me think of something to finally convince my boss to really learn Python and start using it on projects?</p>

<p>Edit: I know that no problem requires only one language, I just meant, are there any specific problems in which dynamic languages excel over static languages.</p>

<p>Edit again: Let me also mention that my boss prompted ME to investigate this. He has put aside hours to research these languages, find a good one, learn it, and then figure out how we can use it. I'm at the last step here, I do not need a lecture on why I should consider my motivation for changing something my company does because they do it for a reason. </p>

1047,249110,32638.0,2008-10-30T02:18:32Z,16,Django: Arbitrary number of unnamed urls.py parameters,"<p>I have a Django model with a large number of fields and 20000+ table rows.  To facilitate human readable URLs and the ability to break down the large list into arbitrary sublists, I would like to have a URL that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/browse/&lt;name1&gt;/&lt;value1&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;/&lt;value2&gt;/ .... etc ....
</code></pre>

<p>where 'name' maps to a model attribute and 'value' is the search criteria for that attribute.  Each ""name"" will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match.</p>

<p>Now, this could be handled with GET parameters, but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user's sake and the search engines.  These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model, so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs.</p>

<p>Ideally each name/value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code>, etc.  However, I don't believe it's possible to defined named patterns via a regex's matched text.  Am I wrong there?</p>

<p>So, it seems I need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/(?:([\w]+)/([\w]+)/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems this should match any sets of two name/value pairs.  While it matches it successfully, it only passes the last name/value pair as parameters to the view function.  My guess is that each match is overwriting the previous match.  Under the guess that the containing (?:...)+ is causing it, I tried a simple repeating pattern instead:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/([\w]+/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>... and got the same problem, but this time <code>*args</code> only includes the last matched pattern.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of Django's url dispatcher, and/or Python's regex support?  It seems either of these methods should work.  Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional (.*) pattern?</p>

<p>I want to changed the request verb of a request in the case a
parameter _method is provided, for example if a POST request comes in
with a parameter _method=PUT, I need to change the request to call the
put method of the handler. This is to cope with the way prototype.js
works with verbs like PUT and DELETE(workaround for IE). Here is my
first attempt:</p>

<pre>
class MyRequestHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
   def initialize(self, request, response):
       m = request.get('_method')
       if m:
           request.method = m.upper()
       webapp.RequestHandler.initialize(self, request, response)
</pre>

<p>The problem is, for some reason whenever the redirect is done, the
self.request.params are emptied by the time the handling method(put or
delete) is called, even though they were populated when initialize was
called. Anyone have a clue why this is? As a workaround I thought I
could clone the params at initialize() time, but .copy() did not work,
and I haven't found a way to do that either.</p>

<p>What are the benefits/limitations of using a browser-based interface for a stand-alone application vs. using a normal GUI framework?</p>

<p>I'm working on a Python program currently implement with wxPython for the GUI. The application is simply user-entry forms and dialogs. I am considering moving to PyQt because of the widgets it has (for future expansion), then I realized I could probably just use a browser to do much of the same stuff.</p>

<p>The application currently doesn't require Internet access, though it's a possibility in the future. I was thinking of using <a href=""http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/"">Karrigell</a> for the web framework if I go browser-based.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> For clarification, as of right now the application would be browser-based, not web-based. All the information would be stored locally on the client computer; no server calls would need to be made and no Internet access required (it may come later though). It would simply be a browser GUI instead of a wxPython/PyQt GUI. Hope that makes sense.</p>

The script creates a new directory and creates new files for each snip that is taken out.  I have to now evaluate each of the files that were created to see if it is what I needed.  The script also creates an html index file with links to each of the snips.  So I can click the hyperlink to see the file, make a note in a spreadsheet to  indicate if the file is correct or not and then use the back button in the browser to take me back to the index list.  </p>

<p>I was sitting here wondering if I could somehow create a delete button in the browser next to the hyperlink.

<p>I have a model for which I have not given any primary_key. Django, consequently, automatically provides an AutoField that is called ""id"". Everything's fine with that. But now, I have to change the ""verbose_name"" of that AutoField to something other than ""id"". I cannot override the ""id"" field the usual way, because that would require dropping/resetting the entire model and its data (which is strictly not an option). I cannot find another way around it. Does what I want even possible to achieve? If you may suggest any alternatives that would get me away with what I want without having to drop the model/table, I'd be happy.</p>

For example (in Python syntax):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict = { re.compile(r'foo.') : 12, re.compile(r'^FileN.*$') : 35 }
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['food']
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['foot in my mouth']
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['FileNotFoundException: file.x does not exist']
35
</code></pre>

<p>(Obviously the above example won't work as written in Python, but that's the sort of thing I'd like to be able to do.)</p>

<p>I can think of a naive way to implement this, in which I iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them, but then I lose the O(1) lookup time of a hash map and instead have O(n), where n is the number of keys in my dictionary.  This is potentially a big deal, as I expect this dictionary to grow very large, and I will need to search it over and over again (actually I'll need to iterate over it for every line I read in a text file, and the files can be hundreds of megabytes in size).</p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this, without resorting to O(n) efficiency?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you know of a way to accomplish this sort of a lookup in a database, that would be great, too.</p>

<p>(Any programming language is fine -- I'm using Python, but I'm more interested in the data structures and algorithms here.)</p>

<p>Someone pointed out that more than one match is possible, and that's absolutely correct.  Ideally in this situation I'd like to return a list or tuple containing all of the matches.  I'd settle for the first match, though.</p>

<p>I can't see O(1) being possible in that scenario; I'd settle for anything less than O(n), though.  Also, the underlying data structure could be anything, but the basic behavior I'd like is what I've written above: lookup a string, and return the value(s) that match the regular expression keys.</p>

<p>For our customer we have created (as part of a larger application) a
graphical designer which they can use to build ""scenario's"".</p>

<p>These scenario's consist of ""Composites"" which in turn consist
of ""Commands"". These command objects all derive from CommandBase and
implement an interface called ICompilable.</p>

<p>The scenario class also implements ICompilable. When Compile() is called
on a command an array of bytes is returned which can then be send to the device
for which they are intended (can't disclose to much info about that hardware, sorry)</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea:</p>

<pre><code>var scenario = new Scenario();

scenario.Add(new DelayCommand(1));
scenario.Add(new CountWithValueCommand(1,ActionEnum.Add,1));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new WaitCommand(3));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new SkipIfCommand(1,OperatorEnum.SmallerThan,10));
scenario.Add(new JumpCommand(2));

byte[] compiledData = scenario.Compile();
</code></pre>

<p>The graphical designer abstracts all this from the user and allows
him (or her) to simply drag en drop composites onto the designer surface.
(Composites can group commands so we can provide building blocks for returning tasks)</p>

<p>Recently our customer came to us and said, ""well the designer is really cool,
but we have some people who would rather have some kind of programming language,
just something simple.""</p>

a nicer structure, etc...</p>

people writing their own language an parsers, etc...</p>

    Composites are loaded dynamically at runtime (along with their graphical designer)

It happens that I want the compressed output to be deterministic, because that's often a really convenient property for things to have in general -- if some non-gzip-aware process is going to be looking for changes in the output, say, or if the output is going to be cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the output is different every time.  As far as I can tell, the only reason for this is the timestamp field in the gzip header, which the Python module always populates with the current time.  I don't think you're actually allowed to have a gzip stream without a timestamp in it, which is too bad.</p>

<p>In any case, there doesn't seem to be a way for the caller of Python's <code>gzip</code> module to supply the correct modification time of the underlying data.  (The actual <code>gzip</code> program seems to use the timestamp of the input file when possible.)  I imagine this is because basically the only thing that ever cares about the timestamp is the <code>gunzip</code> command when writing to a file -- and, now, me, because I want deterministic output.  Is that so much to ask?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SERVER&gt; &lt;SERVERKEY&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; &lt;FOLDERPATH&gt; &lt;RETENTION&gt; &lt;TRANSFERMODE&gt; &lt;OUTPUTPATH&gt; &lt;LOGTO&gt; &lt;OPTIONAL-MAXSIZE&gt; &lt;OPTIONAL-OFFSET&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Most of these fields are just simple words, but some of them can be paths, such as FOLDERPATH, OUTPUTPATH, these paths can also be paths with a filename and wildcard appended.</p>

<p>Retention is a number, and transfer mode can be bin or ascii. The issue is, LOGTO which can be a path with the logfile name appended to it or can be NO, which means no log file.</p>

<p>The main issue, is the optional arguments, they are both numbers, and OFFSET can't exist without MAXSIZE, but MAXSIZE can exist without offset.</p>

<p>Heres some examples:</p>

<pre><code>loveserver love copy /muffin* 20 bin C:\Puppies\ NO 256 300
loveserver love copy /muffin* 20 bin C:\Puppies\ NO 256
loveserver love copy /hats* 300 ascii C:\Puppies\no\ C:\log\love.log 256
</code></pre>

<p>Now the main issue, is that paths can have spaces in them, so if I use . to match everything, the regex ends up breaking, when parsing the optional arguments where the LOG destination ends up getting attached to the outputpath.</p>

<p>Also if I end up using . and start removing parts of it, the regex will start putting things where it shouldn't.</p>

<p>Heres my regex:</p>

<pre><code>^(\s+)?(?P&lt;SRCHOST&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;SRCKEY&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;COMMAND&gt;COPY)(\s+)(?P&lt;SRCDIR&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;RETENTION&gt;\d+)(\s+)(?P&lt;TRANSFER_MODE&gt;BIN|ASC|BINARY|ASCII)(\s+)(?P&lt;DSTDIR&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;LOGFILE&gt;.+)(\s+)?(?P&lt;SIZE&gt;\d+)?(\s+)?(?P&lt;OFFSET&gt;\d+)?$

The amounts of the individual transactions will be randomized.  There will also be a year showing on the image that will increment every n seconds.</p>

<p>Eseentially, pulls in the salt from the DB and b64 decodes it into a binary representation.  It does a ""GetBytes"" on the raw password and then it concatinates them, salt first.</p>

<p>It then runs the SHA1 algorithm on this new string, base64 encodes it, and compares it against the value stored in the database.</p>

<p>I've attempted to write some code to try and reproduce these hashes in Python and I'm failing.  I won't be able to use them in Django until I can figure out how this translates over.  Here's how I'm testing:</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib
from base64 import b64decode, b64encode

b64salt = ""kDP0Py2QwEdJYtUX9cJABg==""
b64hash = ""OJF6H4KdxFLgLu+oTDNFodCEfMA=""
binsalt = b64decode(b64salt)
password_string = 'password'

m1 = hashlib.sha1()
# Pass in salt
m1.update(binsalt)
# Pass in password
m1.update(password_string)
# B64 encode the binary digest
if b64encode(m1.digest()) == b64hash:
    print ""Logged in!""
else:
    print ""Didn't match""
    print b64hash
    print b64encode(m1.digest())

<p>I'm wondering if anyone can see any flaws in my approach or can suggest an alternate method.  Perhaps you can take the algorithms above and the known password and salt above and produce the hash on your system?</p>

<p>Say I've got a column 'foo' in my database and I want to increment it.  In straight sqlite, this is easy:</p>

cur = db.cursor()
cur.execute('update table stuff set foo = foo + 1')

md = sqlalchemy.MetaData(engine)
table = sqlalchemy.Table('stuff', md, autoload=True)
upd = table.update(values={table.c.foo:table.c.foo+1})
engine.execute(upd)

# snip creation of session object
for c in session.query(Stuff):
    c.foo = c.foo + 1
session.flush()
session.commit()

<p>This does the right thing, but it takes just under fifty times as long as the other two approaches.  I presume that's because it has to bring all the data into memory before it can work with it.</p>

<p>â¢ How many clients can a server support?<br />
â¢ How many concurrent searches can a server support?<br />
â¢ How much data can we store in the database?<br />
â¢ Etc.</p>

<p>Key to all these questions is response time.  We need to be able to measure how response time and performance degrades as new load is introduced so that we could for example, produce some kind of pretty graph we could throw at clients to give them an idea what kind of performance to expect with a given hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Right now we just put out fingers in the air and make educated guesses based on what we already know about the system from experience.  As the product is put under more demanding conditions, this is proving to be inadequate for our needs going forward though.</p>

<p>I've been given the task of devising a method to get such answers in a meaningful way.  I realise that this is not a question that anyone can answer definitively but I'm looking for suggestions about how people have gone about doing such work on their own systems.</p>

This OOP stuff is slowly coming together but I am still fuzzy on a lot of the concepts.  Below is a section of code.  I am trying to use a button click to create an instance of another class.  Specifically-I have my main panel in one class and I wanted to instance a secondary panel when a user clicked on one of the menu items on the main panel.  I made all of this work when the secondary panel was just a function.  I can't seem to get ti to work as a class.  </p>

<p>I wrote a small piece of program in C, then compiled and objdumped the code. After that I inserted it to my python script, therefore the x86_64 code is correct:</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import cast, CFUNCTYPE, c_char_p, c_long

buffer = ''.join(map(chr, [ #0000000000000000 &lt;add&gt;:
  0x55,                     # push   %rbp
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,         # mov    %rsp,%rbp
  0x48, 0x89, 0x7d, 0xf8,   # mov    %rdi,-0x8(%rbp)
  0x48, 0x8b, 0x45, 0xf8,   # mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax
  0x48, 0x83, 0xc0, 0x0a,   # add    $0xa,%rax
  0xc9,                     # leaveq 
  0xc3,                     # retq
]))

fptr = cast(c_char_p(buffer), CFUNCTYPE(c_long, c_long))
print fptr(1234)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, why does this script keeps doing segmentation fault whenever I run it?</p>

<p>I have yet a question about mprotect and no execution flag. It is said to protect against most basic security exploits like buffer overruns. But what is the real reason it's in use? You could just keep on writing until you hit the .text, then inject your instructions into a nice, PROT_EXEC -area. Unless, of course, you use a write protection in .text</p>

<p>But then, why have that PROT_EXEC everywhere anyway? Wouldn't it just help tremendously that your .text section is write protected?</p>

<p>However, I always get an invalid block or some syntax error when I do anything like that (by that I mean {% %} code inside a loop). Python doesn't have {} to signify ""scope"" so I think this might be my problem? Am I formatting my code wrong?</p>

<p>Edit: the exact error is: <code>Invalid block tag: 'embed2'</code></p>

<p>Edit2: Since someone said what I'm doing is not supported by Django templates, I rewrote the code, putting the logic in the view. I now have:</p>

<pre><code>embed_list = []
for embed in embeds:
	embed_list[len(embed_list):] = [embed.replace(""&amp;lt;"", ""&lt;"")] #this is line 35
return render_to_response(""scanvideos.html"", {

<p>Is there some way to force sqlite to perform a case <em>in</em>sensitive comparison when checking for uniqueness?</p>

<p>I can't seem to find an option for this in Django's docs and I'm wondering if there's something that I can do directly to sqlite to get it to behave the way I want. :-)</p>

One of the problems I am dealing with is that I have situations where the colspans are different across header rows.  (Header rows are the rows that need to be combined to get the column headings in my jargon) That is one column may span a number of columns above or below it and the words need to be appended or prepended based on the spanning.  Below is a routine to do this.  I use BeautifulSoup to pull the colspans and to pull the contents of each cell in each row.  longHeader is the contents of the header row with the most items, spanLong is a list with the colspans of each item in the row.  This works but it is not looking very Pythonic.  </p>

<p>Alos-it is not going to work if the diff is &lt;0, I can fix that with the same approach I used to get this to work.  But before I do I wonder if anyone can quickly look at this and suggest a more Pythonic approach.  I am a long time SAS programmer and so I struggle to break the mold-well I will write code as if I am writing a SAS macro.</p>

for each in range(len(shortHeader)):

    sumSpanShort=sumSpanShort+spanShort[each]
    spanDiff=sumSpanShort-sumSpanLong
    if spanDiff==0:
        combinedHeader.append([longHeader[longHeaderCount]+' '+shortHeader[each]])
        longHeaderCount=longHeaderCount+1

<pre><code>if type == 'extractTitle':
    extractTitle(dom)
if type == 'extractMetaTags':
    extractMetaTags(dom)

<pre><code>{

    'extractMetaTags': extractMetaTags
}[type](dom)

<p>not sure if the mail is malformed!
seems if you get an html page you have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>        parts=self._currentEmailParsedInstance.get_payload()
        print parts[0].get_content_type()
        ..._multipart/alternative_
        textParts=parts[0].get_payload()
        print textParts[0].get_content_type()
        ..._text/plain_
        body=textParts[0].get_payload()
        print body
        ...get the text without a problem!!

<p>However, I'm looking through the <em>wxPython in Action</em> book and notice that ""self"" isn't used all the time. For example:</p>

<pre><code> import wx

    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, 'Text Entry Example',
            size=(300, 100))
        panel = wx.Panel(self, -1)
        basicLabel = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, ""Basic Control:"")
        basicText = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, ""I've entered some text!"",
            size=(175, -1))
        basicText.SetInsertionPoint(0)
        pwdLabel = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, ""Password:"")

        sizer.AddMany([basicLabel, basicText, pwdLabel, pwdText])
        panel.SetSizer(sizer)

<p>The one below does use ""self"".</p>

<pre><code>import wx
class ButtonFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, 'Button Example',
            size=(300, 100))
        panel = wx.Panel(self, -1)

        self.button.SetDefault()
    def OnClick(self, event):
        self.button.SetLabel(""Clicked"")

<p>If I remember correctly, ""self"" is reference to a particular instance of the class, so when is it not necessary? Is there a general rule of thumb?</p>

1223,280797,,2008-11-11T12:51:43Z,16,Calculate poisson probability percentage,"<p>When you use the POISSON function in Excel (or in OpenOffice Calc), it takes two arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>an integer</li>
<li>an 'average' number</li>

<p>In Python (I tried RandomArray and NumPy) it returns an array of random poisson numbers.
What I really want is the percentage that this event will occur (it is a constant number and the array has every time different numbers - so is it an average?).</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>print poisson(2.6,6)

1226,281922,35247.0,2008-11-11T19:38:34Z,4,How can I do synchronous rpc calls,"<p>I'm building a program that has a class used locally, but I want the same class to be used the same way over the network. This means I need to be able to make synchronous calls to any of its public methods. The class reads and writes files, so I think XML-RPC is too much overhead. I created a basic rpc client/server using the examples from twisted, but I'm having trouble with the client.</p>

<pre><code>c = ClientCreator(reactor, Greeter)
c.connectTCP(self.host, self.port).addCallback(request)
reactor.run()
</code></pre>

<p>This works for a single call, when the data is received I'm calling reactor.stop(), but if I make any more calls the reactor won't restart. Is there something else I should be using for this? maybe a different twisted module or another framework?</p>

<p>(I'm not including the details of how the protocol works, because the main point is that I only get one call out of this.)</p>

<p>Addendum &amp; Clarification:</p>

<p>I shared a google doc with notes on what I'm doing. <a href=""http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv9rsfd_37ftshgpgz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv9rsfd_37ftshgpgz</a></p>

<p>I have a version written that uses fuse and can combine multiple local folders into the fuse mount point. The file access is already handled within a class, so I want to have servers that give me network access to the same class. After continuing to search, I suspect pyro (<a href=""http://pyro.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a>) might be what I'm really looking for (simply based on reading their home page right now) but I'm open to any suggestions.</p>

<p>I could achieve similar results by using an nfs mount and combining it with my local folder, but I want all of the peers to have access to the same combined filesystem, so that would require every computer to bee an nfs server with a number of nfs mounts equal to the number of computers in the network.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
I have decided to use rpyc as it gave me exactly what I was looking for. A server that keeps an instance of a class that I can manipulate as if it was local. If anyone is interested I put my project up on Launchpad (<a href=""http://launchpad.net/dstorage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://launchpad.net/dstorage</a>).</p>

<p>For example I need to solve a matrix:</p>

<pre><code>4.0x -2.0y 1.0z =11.0
1.0x +5.0y -3.0z =-6.0
2.0x +2.0y +5.0z =7.0
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code I use to import the matrix from a text file:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('gauss.dat')
lines =  f.readlines()
f.close()

j=0
for line in lines:
    bits = string.split(line, ',')
    s=[]
    for i in range(len(bits)):

            #print s[i]
    b.append(s)
    y.append(float(bits[len(bits)-1]))
</code></pre>

<p>I need to solve using gauss-seidel so I need to rearrange the equations for x, y, and z:</p>

<pre><code>x=(11+2y-1z)/4
y=(-6-x+3z)/5
z=(7-2x-2y)/7
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code I use to rearrange the equations. <code>b</code> is a matrix of coefficients and <code>y</code> is the answer vector:</p>

<pre><code>def equations(b,y):
    i=0
    eqn=[]
    row=[]
    while(i&lt;len(b)):
        j=0
        row=[]
        while(j&lt;len(b)):
            if(i==j):
                row.append(y[i]/b[i][i])
            else:

            j=j+1
        eqn.append(row)
        i=i+1
    return eqn
</code></pre>

<p>However the answers I get back aren't precise to the decimal place.</p>

<p>For example, upon rearranging the second equation from above, I should get:</p>

<pre><code>y=-1.2-.2x+.6z

<pre><code>y=-1.2-0.20000000000000001x+0.59999999999999998z
</code></pre>

<p>This might not seem like a big issue but when you raise the number to a very high power the error is quite large. Is there a way around this? I tried the <code>Decimal</code> class but it does not work well with powers (i.e, <code>Decimal(x)**2</code>).</p>

I figured that keys did not need to be unique within a section, otherwise the parser would just return a mapping. I designed my config file schema around this assumption, then sadly realized that this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ConfigParser import ConfigParser
&gt;&gt;&gt; from StringIO import StringIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; fh = StringIO(""""""
... [Some Section]
... spam: eggs
... spam: ham

&gt;&gt;&gt; parser.readfp(fh)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print parser.items('Some Section')
[('spam', 'ham')]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I went back and found the part of the docs that I <em>should</em> have read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sections are normally stored in a
  builtin dictionary. An alternative
  dictionary type can be passed to the
  ConfigParser constructor. For example,
  if a dictionary type is passed that
  sorts its keys, the sections will be
  sorted on write-back, as will be the
  keys within each section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To keep my existing configuration file scheme (which I really like now ;) I'm thinking of passing a mapping-like object as mentioned above that accumulates values instead of clobbering them. Is there a simpler way to prevent key/value collapse that I'm missing? Instead of making a crazy adapter (that could break if <code>ConfigParser</code>'s implementation changes) should I just write a variant of the <code>ConfigParser</code> itself?</p>

<p>I feel like this may be one of those 'duh' moments where I'm only seeing the difficult solutions.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit:]</strong> Here's a more precise example of how I'd like to use the same key multiple times:</p>

The upshot of those was that I was building a prototype of an AI-based application for the web, and I wondered what language(s) to use. The conclusion seemed to be that I should go for something like python and then convert any critical bits into something faster like Java or C/C++.</p>

<p>That sounds fine to me, but I'm wondering now whether python is really the right language to use for building a web application. Most web applications I've worked on in the past were C/C++ CGI and then php. The php I found much easier to work with as it made linking the user interface to the back-end so much easier, and also it made more logical sense to me. </p>

<p>I've not used python before, but what I'm basically wondering is how easy is CGI programming in python? Will I have to go back to the tedious way of doing it in C/C++ where you have to store HTML code in templates and have the CGI read them in and replace special codes with appropriate values or is it possible to have the templates <em>be</em> the code as with php?</p>

<p>I'm probably asking a deeply ignorant question here, for which I apologise, but hopefully someone will know what I'm getting at! My overall question is: is writing web applications in python a good idea, and is it as easy as it is with php?</p>

<p>I.e. there are multiple <code>Companies</code>, each having a range of <code>Rates</code> and <code>Clients</code>.  Each <code>Client</code> should have a base <code>Rate</code> that is chosen from it's parent <code>Company's Rates</code>, not another <code>Company's Rates</code>.</p>

<p>When creating a form for adding a <code>Client</code>, I would like to remove the <code>Company</code> choices (as that has already been selected via an ""Add Client"" button on the <code>Company</code> page) and limit the <code>Rate</code> choices to that <code>Company</code> as well.</p>

<p>How do I go about this in Django 1.0?  </p>

<p>My current <code>forms.py</code> file is just boilerplate at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>from models import *
from django.forms import ModelForm

class ClientForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Client
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>views.py</code> is also basic:</p>

<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render_to_response, get_object_or_404
from models import *
from forms import *

def addclient(request, company_id):
    the_company = get_object_or_404(Company, id=company_id)

    if request.POST:
    	form = ClientForm(request.POST)
    	if form.is_valid():
    		form.save()
    		return HttpResponseRedirect(the_company.get_clients_url())
    else:
    	form = ClientForm()

    return render_to_response('addclient.html', {'form': form, 'the_company':the_company})
</code></pre>

<p>In Django 0.96 I was able to hack this in by doing something like the following before rendering the template:</p>

<pre><code>manipulator.fields[0].choices = [(r.id,r.name) for r in Rate.objects.filter(company_id=the_company.id)]
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.limit_choices_to""><code>ForeignKey.limit_choices_to</code></a> seems promising but I don't know how to pass in <code>the_company.id</code> and I'm not clear if that will work outside the Admin interface anyway.</p>

<p>It uses simple TCP connections and spends a lot of time waiting for packets to come back (up to half a second). Thus the threads don't need to fully execute (i.e. first half sends a packet, context switch, does stuff, comes back to thread which has network data waiting for it).</p>

<p>I suspect I can improve performance by modifying the <code>sys.setcheckinterval</code> from the default of 100 (which lets up to 100 bytecodes execute before switching to another thread).</p>

<p>But without knowing how many bytecodes are actually executing in a thread or function I'm flying blind and simply guessing values, testing and relying on the testing shows a measurable difference (which is difficult since the amount of code being executed is minimal; a simple socket connection, thus network jitter will likely affect any measurements more than changing sys.setcheckinterval).</p>

<p>Thus I would like to find out how many bytecodes are in certain code executions (i.e. total for a function or in execution of a thread) so I can  make more intelligent guesses at what to set sys.setcheckinterval to.</p>

1321,298446,11522.0,2008-11-18T11:05:53Z,0,Looping in Django forms,"<p>I've just started building a prototype application in Django. I started out by working through the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">Django app tutorial on the Django site</a> which was pretty helpful, and gave me what I needed to get started. Now I have a couple of what I hope are very simple questions:</p>

<p>I want to put a loop into views.py, looping over a set of variables that have been passed in from a form. So I have a load of items in the HTML form, each of which has a SELECT drop-down list for people to select a score from 0-10, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""score1""&gt;
  &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have, let's say, 100 of these variables, score1, score2, score3, ..., score99, score100. When the form is submitted, I want to loop through each of these variables and see if it's been set (i.e. is not 0) and if so, I want to store that value in a suitable place in the database. My problem is that I can't figure out how to loop through those variables.
I'm guessing that I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for o in request.POST.all

endfor
</code></pre>

<p>but then I'm really not sure what to do with that.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for someone to write the code for me, really: I just would like some guidance on how to write a loop like this in python / Django, and also maybe some pointers as to a good reference guide I can either see online or buy that will give me access to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also, the select object above I created pretty much by hand, and I'd really like to be able to ue a loop to generate it in the template in the first place. My template currently has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
{% for movie in movie_list %}
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; {{ movie }} &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;select name=""score{{ movie.id }}""&gt;
         &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;

       &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like there must be a way to create a simple loop that counts from 1 to 10 that would generate most of those options for me, but I can't figure out how to do that...</p>

1323,298779,11522.0,2008-11-18T13:55:17Z,3,Form (or Formset?) to handle multiple table rows in Django,"<p>I'm working on my first Django application. In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating (out of 10) to each film. I've been able to use the {{ form }} and {{ formset }} syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once? </p>

<p>At first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I can't see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Currently, my views.py has this code:</p>

<pre><code>def survey(request):
        ScoreFormSet = formset_factory(ScoreForm)
        if request.method == 'POST':
                formset = ScoreFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)
                if formset.is_valid():
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        else:
                formset = ScoreFormSet()
        return render_to_response('cf/survey.html', {
                'formset':formset,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>And my survey.html has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/survey/"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
{{ formset }}
&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;input type = ""submit"" value = ""Submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py are:</p>

<pre><code>class Score(models.Model):
        movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie)
        score = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)

class ScoreForm(ModelForm):
        class Meta:
                model = Score
</code></pre>

<p>So, in case the above is not clear, what I'm aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.</p>

<p>If anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, I'd be most grateful.</p>

1329,299913,11522.0,2008-11-18T19:51:54Z,3,Calling Java (or python or perl) from a PHP script,"<p>I've been trying to build a simple prototype application in Django, and am reaching the point of giving up, sadly, as it's just too complicated (I know it would be worth it in the long-run, but I really just don't have enough time available -- I need something up and running in a few days). So, I'm now thinking of going with PHP instead, as it's the method for creating dynamic web content I'm most familiar with, and I know I can get something working quickly.</p>

<p>My application, while simple, is probably going to be doing some reasonably complex AI stuff, and it may be that libraries don't exist for what I need in PHP. So I'm wondering how easy / possible it is for a PHP script to ""call"" a Java program or Python script or a program or script in another language. It's not entirely clear to me what exactly I mean by ""call"" in this context, but I guess I probably mean that ideally I'd like to define a function in, let's say Java, and then be able to call it from PHP. If that's not possible, then I guess my best bet (assuming I do go with PHP) will be to pass control directly to the external program explicitly through a POST or GET to a CGI program or similar.</p>

<p>Feel free to convince me I should stick with Django, although I'm really at the point where I just can't figure out what model I need to produce the HTML form I want, which seems such a basic thing that I fear for my chances of doing anything more complex...</p>

<p>Alternatively, anyone who can offer any advice on linking PHP and other languages, that'll be grateful received.</p>

I have included a small piece of the code to show how this works. For some reason get_file does get called and the class gets created, but instead of fuse calling .read() on the class from get_file (file_class) fuse keeps calling Dstorage.read() which defeats the purpose in moving the read function out of that class.</p>

<pre><code>class Dstorage(Fuse, Distributor):
    def get_file(self, server, path, flags, *mode):
        pass

        command1.py

<p>Here's what I need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do a POST with a few parameters and headers.</li>
<li>Follow a redirect</li>
<li>Retrieve the HTML body.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I'm relatively new to python, but the two things I've tested so far haven't worked. First I used httplib, with putrequest() (passing the parameters within the URL), and putheader(). This didn't seem to follow the redirects.</p>

<p>Then I tried urllib and urllib2, passing both headers and parameters as dicts. This seems to return the login page, instead of the page I'm trying to login to, I guess it's because of lack of cookies or something.</p>

<p>Am I missing something simple?</p>

<p>Okay. Take a deep breath. Here are the rules. Take <em>two</em> thirty sided dice (yes, <a href=""http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/k/koplow/dice/d30"" rel=""nofollow"">they do exist</a>) and roll them simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the two numbers</li>
<li>If both dice show &lt;= 5 or >= 26, throw again and <em>add</em> the result to what you have</li>
<li>If one is &lt;= 5 and the other >= 26, throw again and <em>subtract</em> the result from what 
you have</li>
<li>Repeat until either is > 5 and &lt; 26!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you write some code (see below), roll those dice a few million times and you count how often you receive each number as the final result, you get a curve that is pretty flat left of 1, around 45Â° degrees between 1 and 60 and flat above 60. The chance to roll 30.5 or better is greater than 50%, to roll better than 18 is 80% and to roll better than 0 is 97%.</p>

<p>Now the question: Is it possible to write a program to <em>calculate</em> the <em>exact</em> value f(x), i.e. the probability to roll a certain value?</p>

<p>Background: For our role playing game ""Jungle of Stars"" we looked for a way to keep random events in check. The rules above guarantee a much more stable outcome for something you try :)</p>

<p>Specifically, I <i>want to use</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The models and database abstraction</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/#the-low-level-cache-api"">caching API</a>, although I want to avoid database lookups by caching, not HTML generation, and since the caching framework in Django is intended for the latter, I'm not sure yet whether that's really appropriate.</li>

<p>I would <i>not use</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Templating</li>
<li>urlconfigs</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, more exactly, I'm neither using HTTP nor HTML. So basically, I have a different input / output chain than usual.</p>

<p>Can this work?</p>

<p>My personal killer feature in Django is the Object / database mapping that I can do with the models, so if there's another technology (doesn't have to be Python, I'm in the design phase and I'm pretty agnostic about languages and platforms) that gives me the same abilities, that would be great, too.</p>

Currently, I have a single extension module, ""rng"". I am using Python's Distutils to build and install the module. I can compile and install the module, but when I try to import the module using <code>import lehmer.rng</code> or <code>from lehmer import rng</code>, the Python interpreter throws an <code>ImportError</code> exception. I can import ""lehmer"" fine.</p>

<p>Here are the contents of my <code>setup.py</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup, Extension

exts = [Extension(""rng"", [""lehmer/rng.c""])]

      packages=[""lehmer""],
      ext_package=""lehmer"",
      ext_modules=exts)

<p>My <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable is set correctly, so that's not the problem (and as noted before, I can <code>import lehmer</code> just fine, so I <em>know</em> that <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is not the issue). Python uses the following search paths (as reported by <code>sys.path</code>):</p>

<pre><code>['', '/scratch/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python25.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.5', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/Numeric', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/PIL', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/SaX', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode', '/usr/local/lib64/python2.5/site-packages']

Am somewhat new to thinking in a non-relational manner and want to try avoiding any obvious pitfalls.  It's my understanding that a basic principal is that ""storage is cheap, don't worry about data duplication"" as you might in a normalized RDBMS.    </p>

<p>What I'd like to model is:</p>

<p>A blog article which can be given 0-n tags. Many blog articles can share the same tag.  When retrieving data would like to allow retrieval of all articles matching a tag.  In many ways very similar to the approach taken here at stackoverflow.</p>

<p>My normal mindset would be to create a many-to-may relationship between tags and blog articles.  However, I'm thinking in the context of GAE that this would be expensive, although I have seen examples of it being done. </p>

<p>Perhaps using a ListProperty containing each tag as part of the article entities, and a second data model to track tags as they're added and deleted?  This way no need for any relationships and the ListProperty still allows queries where any list element matching will return results.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on the most efficient way to approach this on GAE?</p>

1357,304655,39182.0,2008-11-20T08:40:40Z,4,The best way to invoke methods in Python class declarations?,"<p>Say I am declaring a class <code>C</code> and a few of the declarations are very similar. I'd like to use a function <code>f</code> to reduce code repetition for these declarations. It's possible to just declare and use <code>f</code> as usual:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     w = f(42)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.w
'&lt;42&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f(4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unbound method f() must be called with C instance as first argument (got int instance instead)
</code></pre>

<p>Oops! I've inadvertently exposed <code>f</code> to the outside world, but it doesn't take a <code>self</code> argument (and can't for obvious reasons). One possibility would be to <code>del</code> the function after I use it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     del f
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'f'
</code></pre>

<p>But what if I want to use <code>f</code> again later, after the declaration? It won't do to delete the function. I could make it ""private"" (i.e., prefix its name with <code>__</code>) and give it the <code>@staticmethod</code> treatment, but invoking <code>staticmethod</code> objects through abnormal channels gets very funky:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     @staticmethod
...     def __f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = __f.__get__(1)(9)   # argument to __get__ is ignored...
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I have to use the above craziness because <code>staticmethod</code> objects, which are descriptors, are not themselves callable. I need to recover the function wrapped by the <code>staticmethod</code> object before I can call it.</p>

<p>There has got to be a better way to do this. How can I cleanly declare a function in a class, use it during its declaration, and also use it later from within the class? Should I even be doing this?</p>

<p>My understanding of the internals of the mp3 format is minimal. Ideally, I am looking for a library that would abstract those details away. I would prefer to use Python (but could be convinced otherwise).</p>

<p>I would like to modify a set of mp3 files in a fairly simple way. I am not so much interested in the ID3 tags but in the audio itself. I want to be able to delete sections (e.g. drop 10 seconds from the 3rd minute), and insert sections (e.g. add credits to the end.)</p>

<p>My understanding is that the mp3 format is lossy, and so decoding it to (for example) PCM format, making the modifications, and then encoding it again to MP3 will lower the audio quality. (I would love to hear that I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I <em>conjecture</em> that if I stay in mp3 format, there will be some sort of minimum frame or packet-size to deal with, so the granularity of the operations may be coarser. I can live with that, as long as I get an accuracy of within a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""http://pymedia.org/"">PyMedia</a>, but it requires me to migrate to PCM to process the data. Similarly, <a href=""http://lame.sourceforge.net"">LAME</a> wants to help me encode, but not access the data in place. I have seen several other libraries that only deal with the ID3 tags.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a Python MP3 library? Alternatively, can you disabuse me of my assumption that going to PCM and back is bad and avoidable?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I looks like I'll need five things
  out of every line. And bear in mind
  that any one of these area's may be
  empty. Meaning there will be just two
  commas right next to each other. Such

<p>In my Django code, I use the <code>@login_required</code> decorator from <code>django.contrib.auth.decorators</code> to mark which view requires authentication. The default behavior when a not authenticated user clicks it is to redirect him/her to login page, and then pass the target page. </p>

<p>What I saw on some sites, and really liked, is that when user clicks a link leading to a place restricted to logged-only users, instead of getting redirected to a login page, he/she gets a popup window (via JavaScript) asking him/her to log in or register. There's no redirection part, so no need for a user to use the ""back"" key if he/she decides he/she really doesn't like the website enough to waste the time registering.</p>

<p>So, the qestion is:  how would you manage the task of automatically marking some links as ""restricted"" so JavaScript can handle their <code>onclick</code> event and display a ""please log in"" popup? </p>

<p>I have models to the tune of:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal(models.Model):
  pass

class Cat(Animal):
  def __unicode__(self):
    return ""This is a cat""

class Dog(Animal):
  def __unicode__(self):
    return ""This is a dog""

class AnimalHome(models.Model):
  animal = models.ForeignKey(Animal)
</code></pre>

<p>I have instantiated no Animals, because this is supposed to be a virtual class.  I have instantiated Cats and Dogs, but in the Admin Page for AnimalHome, my choices for Animals are displayed as ""Animal object"" (the default __unicode__(), I guess) as opposed to the __unicode__ I have defined for the two subclasses.  Help.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>The abstract base class issue is a red herring wrt to this question, I think.  Even if Animal was not supposed to be abstract, I still have the problem that, for some reason, since the ForeignKey is defined on Animal and not one of its subclasses, the superclass method is being called instead of the subclass.  In OO programming when you call object.method() you're supposed to get the lowest-subclass's implementation, and you have to do extra work to get any superclass's implementation.  So why is it that having __unicode__ defined on the subclasses is not sufficient for --- actually the problem might be that __unicode__ is not getting called at all because introspection on the Animal class reveals that it's not defined.  So maybe if I define __unicode__ for Animal and have it call subclasses' __unicode__ I could get the desired effect.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay, I think that I understand the ORM issues.  Both these answers have helped me understand this, thank you.  While experimenting with this, I discovered that when Django saves a subclassed model, it does two things: (1) it creates a row for the subclassed object in the superclass's table, and (2) it makes the PK in the subclass table identical to the PK assigned in the superclass table.  This PK in the subclass table is named superclass_ptr.  Based upon this I've concocted the following.  I'd appreciate feedback.</p>

<pre><code>Class Animal(models.Model)
  def __unicode__(self):
    if Dog.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Dog.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    elif Cat.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Cat.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    else:
      return ""An Animal!""
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>It seems that Lawrence is most on-point wrt this question.  Cat and Dog will have disjoint PK sets (and any subclass of Animal will have a PK identical to the record of its superclass), but unfortunately Django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la: ""I'm an Animal.  I know Animals have subclasses Dog and Cat.  Specifically, I'm Animal number 3, and furthermore I just checked and there's a Cat number 3 too.  That means that I'm actually Cat number 3"".  Even though this seems entirely possible and very reasonable (since a Cat won't do anything an Animal couldn't do itself) using Python's introspection.  Thank you all.</p>

<p>I'm building a fair-sized web application with a friend in my own time, and we've decided to go with the Django framework on Python. Django provides us with a lot of features we're going to need, so please don't suggest alternative frameworks.</p>

<p>The only decision I'm having trouble with, is whether we use Python or Jython to develop our application. Now I'm pretty familiar with Java and could possibly benefit from the libraries within the JDK. I know minimal Python, but am using this project as an opportunity to learn a new language - so the majority of work will be written in Python.</p>

<p>The attractiveness of Jython is of course the JVM. The number of python/django enabled web-hosts is extremely minimal - whereas I'm assuming I could drop a jython/django application on a huge variety of hosts. This isn't a massive design decision, but still one I think needs to be decided. I'd really prefer jython over python for the jvm accessibility alone.</p>

<p><b> Questions </b>  </p>

<p>Does Jython have many limitations compared to regular python? Will running django on jython cause problems? How quick is the Jython team to release updates alongside Python? Will Django work as advertised on Jython (with very minimal pre-configuration)?</p>

<p><b> Decision </b></p>

<p>Thanks for the helpful comments. What I think I'm going to do is develop in Jython for the JVM support - but to try to only use Python code/libraries. Portability isn't a major concern so if I need a library in the JDK (not readily available in python), I'll use it. As long as Django is fully supported, I'm happy.</p>

I've built a GUI using wxPython and ObjectiveListView. In its very center, the GUI has a list control displaying data in X rows (the data is loaded by the user) and in five columns.</p>

<p>When the user selects multiple entries from the list control (pressing CTRL or shift while clicking), the ObjectiveListView module gives me a list of dictionaries, the dictionaries containing the data in the rows of the list control. This is exactly what I want, good!</p>

<p>The returned list looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>print MyList
[{'id':1023, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'23.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}, {'id':1024, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'24.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}, {'id':23, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'2.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}]
</code></pre>

<p>All the dictionaries have the same keys, but the values change. The 'id' value is unique. Here the problems start. I want to get the common values for all the items the user selected. In the above list they would be 'sum':'-21,90' and 'target':'Apple Store'.</p>

<p>I don't know how to properly compare the dicts in the list. One big problem is that I don't know beforehand how many dicts the list contains, since it's decided by the user.</p>

<p>I have a vague idea that list comprehensions would be the way to go, but I only know how to compare two lists with list comprehensions, not n lists. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I tested pickle and was able to save and retrieve my data.  However, I need to be able to preserve the order in the output.  One idea I have is to add another key that would be a counter so I could retrieve my data and then sort by the counter.  Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I have a situation where emails come in with different attachments. Certain file types I process others I ignore and dont write to file.
I am caught in a rather nasty situation, because sometimes people send an email as an attachment, and that attached email has legal attachments. </p>

<p>What I want to do is skip that attached email and all its attachments.</p>

<p>using python/jythons std email lib how can i do this?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>to make it clearer</p>

<p>I need to parse an email (named ROOT email), I want to get the attachments from this email using jython.
Next certain attachments are supported ie .pdf .doc etc
now it just so happens that, the clients send an email (ROOT email) with another email message (CHILD email) as an attachment, and in CHILD email it has .pdf attachments and such like.</p>

<p>What I need is: to get rid of any CHILD emails attached to the ROOT email AND the CHILD emails attachments. What happens is I walk over the whole email and it just parses every attachment, BOTH ROOT attachments and CHILD attachments as if they were ROOT attachments.</p>

<p>I cannot have this. I am only interested in ROOT attachements that are legal ie .pdf .doc. xls .rtf .tif .tiff</p>

<p>That should do for now, I have to run to catch a bus!
thanks!</p>

<p>I'm trying to bundle the library and plugins into a Puppet-installable RPM. The actual RPM-building should be straightforward; once I have a <code>distutils</code>-produced distfile I can make it into an RPM based on a .spec file pinched from the Dag or EPEL repos [1]. It's the <code>distutils</code> bit I'm unsure of -- in fact I'm not even sure my library is correctly written for packaging. Here's how it works:</p>

  cache_dir = '/tmp'

  def __init__(self, host, port):
    self.host = host
    self.port = port

  # ...

  def collect(self):
    self.data = self.__parseXML(self.__getXML())

  def total_slots(self):
    return self.data['Service:Documents:TotalSlots']

<p>Plugin code:</p>

<pre><code>from idol7stats import IDOL7Stats
a = IDOL7Stats('db.example.com', 23113)
a.collect()
print a.total_slots()
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I want idol7stats.py to wind up in <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/idol7stats</code>, or something else in Python's search path. What <code>distutils</code> magic do I need? This:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup

setup(name = 'idol7stats',
  author = 'Me',
  author_email = 'me@example.com',
  version = '0.1',
  py_modules = ['idol7stats'])

<p>almost works, except the code goes in <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/idol7stats.py</code>, not a subdirectory. I expect this is down to my not understanding the difference between modules/packages/other containers in Python.</p>

<p>So, what's the rub?</p>

1484,327223,121.0,2008-11-29T05:33:26Z,32,Memory Efficient Alternatives to Python Dictionaries,"<p>In one of my current side projects, I am scanning through some text looking at the frequency of word triplets.  In my first go at it, I used the default dictionary three levels deep.  In other words, topDictionary[word1][word2][word3] returns the number of times these words appear in the text, topdictionary[word1][word2] returns a dictionary with all the words that appeared following words 1 and 2, etc.</p>

<p>This functions correctly, but it is very memory intensive.  In my initial tests it used something like 20 times the memory of just storing the triplets in a text file, which seems like an overly large amount of memory overhead.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that many of these dictionaries are being created with many more slots than are actually being used, so I want to replace the dictionaries with something else that is more memory efficient when used in this manner.  I would strongly prefer a solution that allows key lookups along the lines of the dictionaries.</p>

<p>From what I know of data structures, a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or AVL would probably be ideal, but I would really prefer not to implement them myself.  If possible, I'd prefer to stick with standard python libraries, but I'm definitely open to other alternatives if they would work best.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  A few of the answers so far have suggested using tuples, which didn't really do much for me when I condensed the first two words into a tuple.  I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (ie I want something like the result of topDict[word1,word2].keys() ).  </p>

<p>The current dataset I am playing around with is the most recent version of <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/wikipedia-for-schools.htm"">Wikipedia For Schools</a>.  The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.  I know that there will be some additional overhead for pointers and whatnot, but the difference seems excessive.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you all for the responses so far.</p>

E.g. one can re-publish Blogger.com content using the Google Gdata API.  One can embed re-branded Nabble.com archives into any website, which may provide forum/mailinglist functionality more easily than running the forum itself.</li>

requires login. Accounts on this tool have nothing to do with
system-level accounts -- none of this looks at /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>I am planning to store user accounts in a text file using the same format (roughly) as /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>Despite not using the system-level password files, using crypt seemed
to be a good practice to use, as opposed to storing passwords in
cleartext. (While crypt is certainly better than storing passwords in
cleartext, I'm open to other ways of doing this.)</p>

<p>My crypt knowledge is based on this:
<a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/crypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/crypt.html</a></p>

<p>The documentation seems to ask for something that isn't possible: ""it
is recommended to use the full crypted password as salt when checking
for a password.""</p>

<p>Huh? If I'm creating the crypted password (as in, when creating a user
record) how can I use the crypted password as a salt? It
doesn't exist yet. (I'm assuming that you must use the same salt for creating and checking a password.)</p>

<p>I've tried using the plaintext password as a salt. This does
work, but has two problems; one easily overcome, and one serious:</p>

<p>1) The first two letters of the plaintext password are included in the
crypted password. You can fix this by not writing the first two
characters to the file:</p>

<pre><code>user_record = '%s:%s:%s' % (user_name, crypted_pw[2:], user_type)
</code></pre>

<p>2) By using the plaintext password as the salt, you would seem to be
reducing the amount of entropy in the system. Possibly I'm
misunderstanding the purpose of the salt.</p>

<p>The best practice I've been able to derive is to use the first two
characters from the username as the salt. Would this be appropriate,
or is there something I've missed that makes that a bad move?</p>

hashes from a dictionary. I could use a standard salt for all

1512,330367,40076.0,2008-12-01T09:26:07Z,6,How would one make Python objects persistent in a web-app?,"<p>I'm writing a reasonably complex web application. The Python backend runs an algorithm whose state depends on data stored in several interrelated database tables which does not change often, plus user specific data which does change often. The algorithm's per-user state undergoes many small changes as a user works with the application. This algorithm is used often during each user's work to make certain important decisions.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, re-initializing the state on every request from the (semi-normalized) database data quickly becomes non-feasible. It would be highly preferable, for example, to cache the state's Python object in some way so that it can simply be used and/or updated whenever necessary. However, since this is a web application, there several processes serving requests, so using a global variable is out of the question.</p>

<p>I've tried serializing the relevant object (via pickle) and saving the serialized data to the DB, and am now experimenting with caching the serialized data via memcached. However, this still has the significant overhead of serializing and deserializing the object often.</p>

<p>I've looked at shared memory solutions but the only relevant thing I've found is <a href=""http://poshmodule.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">POSH</a>. However POSH doesn't seem to be widely used and I don't feel easy integrating such an experimental component into my application.</p>

<p>I need some advice! This is my first shot at developing a web application, so I'm hoping this is a common enough issue that there are well-known solutions to such problems. At this point solutions which assume the Python back-end is running on a single server would be sufficient, but extra points for solutions which scale to multiple servers as well :)</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have this application working, currently live and with active users. I started out without doing any premature optimization, and then optimized as needed. I've done the measuring and testing to make sure the above mentioned issue is the actual bottleneck. I'm sure pretty sure I could squeeze more performance out of the current setup, but I wanted to ask if there's a better way.</li>
<li>The setup itself is still a work in progress; assume that the system's architecture can be whatever suites your solution.</li>

The downside is that it may be a bit less convenient to make changes to different windows.</p>

During the final load test, I realised that attachments that should have been in a standard MIME email format is now tied up in some blasted winmail.dat, which means many different outlook clients pollute the internet with this winmail.dat, so that means i need to support winmail.dat. Thus my program failed to process the data correctly.</p>

<p>Please could you give a short description on what winmail.dat is and why it is here to annoy us.</p>

<p>What other surprises can be expected!? what else do I have to watch out for, so far standard MIME emails are catered for. Are there any other jack in the boxes? </p>

<p>Thanks so much for your time.</p>

<p>Is it possible/easy to integrate a 'formwizard' into the admin application?</p>

<p>If not, is extending the admin template a viable option and hooking the rest up manually? Opinions? </p>

<p>Update:
Some clarity in my 'problem'.</p>

<p>I wanted to use the admin app as I was thinking I only needed basic modelforms - one perhaps split across many forms, which would have been the role of formwizard.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<p>Form 1: 10 yes/no questions (each yes corresponds to a new form that needs to be filled out)<br />
if yes is ticked, the corresponding forms are put into a formwizard and displayed for the user to complete. </p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>However the suggested option (modelforms + styling) would take care of the majority of my concerns I guess - and is the seemingly simpler solution.</p>

So the frontend is a HTML page which communicates with the program via AJAX. Can you give me a minimal implementation for the server-side using the python <code>SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler</code>?</p>

<p>A simple example would be a textfield and a button. When the button is pressed the content of the field is send to the server which then sends back a corresponding answer. I am aware that there are many powerful solutions for this in Python, but I would like to keep this very simple.
I already found some nice examples for such a server (e.g. <a href=""http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/julien/04Ajax"">here</a>), but so far I could not come up with a truly minimal one.</p>

<p>In case you wonder why I want to implement the GUI in such a way: My focus for this application is to display lots of data in a nice layout with only minimal interaction - so using HTML+CSS seems most convenient (and I have been already using it for non-interactive data display).</p>

In cases of huge result sets this becomes unusable. I would like instead to actually retrieve the rows one by one from the server.</p>

<p>In Java, following the instructions <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-j-reference-implementation-notes.html"">here</a> (under ""ResultSet""), I create a statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
</code></pre>

<p>This works nicely in Java. My question is: is there a way to do the same in python?</p>

<p>One thing I tried is to limit the query to a 1000 rows at a time, like this:</p>

<pre><code>start_row = 0
while True:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(""SELECT item FROM items LIMIT %d,1000"" % start_row)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    if not rows:
        break
    start_row += 1000
    # Do something with rows...
</code></pre>

<p>However, this seems to get slower the higher start_row is.</p>

<p>And no, using <code>fetchone()</code> instead of <code>fetchall()</code> doesn't change anything.</p>

<h2>Clarification:</h2>

<p>The naive code I use to reproduce this problem looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import MySQLdb

conn = MySQLdb.connect(user=""user"", passwd=""password"", db=""mydb"")
cur = conn.cursor()
print ""Executing query""
cur.execute(""SELECT * FROM bigtable"");

print ""Starting loop""
row = cur.fetchone()
while row is not None:
    print "", "".join([str(c) for c in row])
    row = cur.fetchone()

cur.close()
conn.close()
</code></pre>

<p>On a ~700,000 rows table, this code runs quickly. But on a ~9,000,000 rows table it prints ""Executing Query"" and then hangs for a long long time. That is why it makes no difference if I use <code>fetchone()</code> or <code>fetchall()</code>.</p>

<p>In Flash, we have a shared library between our Flash apps - package xyz. We can make changes to the package without fear of breaking other apps when they are deployed because Flash compiles their code and includes the contents of the library. We deploy the final SWF via RPM, and we're done. Updates to App1 and App2 won't ever break App3.</p>

<p>How would you approach this in Python, the shared library dependency. </p>

<p>App1, App2 and App3, could all require xyz-lib.rpm, and all use the same library files, but an updated xyz-lib.rpm would have to be explicitly tested against App1,2,3 <em>every time</em> there was a new library, and this is just onerous.</p>

<p>My current favorite solution - I could make app1.rpm include the library from when it was packaged - effectively some sort of static linking of the library. This, however, feels inelegant. (although the only additional cost is hard drive space == cheap.)</p>

<p>I know that solid management of the shared library is probably the best solution, but I keep trying to factor in that all the developers are human, and will make mistakes. We're going to make mistakes, and I don't want a deployment of app1 to break app2 and app3 - it's just a lot more to test and debug for.</p>

I am creating several processes each with its own multiprocessor.JoinableQueue instance.  Each process spawns one or more worker threads (subclasses of threading.Thread) which share the JoinableQueue instance (passed in through each Thread's <code>__init__</code> method).  It seems to generally work but occasionally and unpredictably fails with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>  File ""C:\Documents and Settings\Brian\Desktop\testscript.py"", line 49, in run
    self.queue.task_done()
  File ""C:\Python26\lib\multiprocessing\queues.py"", line 293, in task_done
    raise ValueError('task_done() called too many times')
ValueError: task_done() called too many times

<p>My Queue get() and task_done() calls are right after each other so they should be equal.  Anecdotally this seems to occur only when the work done between the get() and the task_done() is VERY quick.  Inserting a small <code>time.sleep(0.01)</code> seems to alleviate the problem.</p>

<p>Any ideas what is going on?  Can I use a multiprocessor Queue with threads instead of the more traditional (Queue.Queue)?</p>

I'm currently using SVN, with only one workspace, so I just have the workspace on my PYTHONPATH. I'm realizing this is less than ideal, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest a more 'proper' way of doing this.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate with a hypothetical situation:
I say I have a module 'eggs', with sub-modules 'foo' and 'bar'. Components in 'bar' use code in foo, so eggs/bar/a.py may 'import eggs.foo'. </p>

<p>Say that 'eggs' is in a git repository. I want to try out some changes to 'foo', so I copy it. The problem is that 'import eggs.foo' in eggs/bar finds the original repository in the PYTHONPATH, so it ends up using the old 'foo' instead of my modified one. </p>

<p>How do I set myself up such that each copy of the module uses its own associated 'foo'? Thanks.</p>

<p>edit- Thanks for the pointer to relative imports. I've read up on it and I can see how to apply it. One problem I'd have with using it is that I've built up a fairly large codebase, and I haven't been too neat about it so most modules have a  quick 'self-test' under <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code>, which from what I've read does not play with relative imports: </p>

</ul>

<p>The other solution I've been able to google up is to deliberately manipulate sys.path, which seems like an even worse hack. Are there any other possibilities?</p>

<p>edit - Thanks for the suggestions. I'd originally misunderstood git branches, so as pointed out branches are exactly what I want. Nonetheless, I hadn't heard of relative imports before so thanks for that as well. I've learnt something new and may incorporate its use.</p>

<p>If you do have a better way to find the parts from a load of HTML (the pattern <code>\d+\[\d+\]</code> is unique to this string in the source), I'll happily change accepted answers. Anything else is academic.</p>

<h3>Why I am using <code>django.contrib.flatpages</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>It allows me to serve (mostly) static pages with minimal URL configuration.</li>
<li>I don't have to write views for each of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I don't need the model <code>FlatPage</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>I leave the content empty and just supply a template path. Therefore I can take advantage of having the source in a file;
<ul>
<li>I can edit the source directly from the file system, without the help of a server (such as admin).</li>
<li>I can take advantage of syntax highlightning and other editor features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With the model I have to maintain fixtures for flatpages.
<ul>
<li>So the data for the same entity is in two seperate places.</li>
<li>If I move the content inside the fixture it'll be more difficult to edit.
<ul>
<li>Even if fixture maintenance was a non-issue I'd still need to dump and load these fixtures again and again during development.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>What I am looking for</h3>

<p>Basically; getting rid of <code>FlatPage</code> model while maintaining <code>contrib.flatpages</code> functionality. I don't have a clear idea how this should be solved. If there's a clean way of modifying (like <code>add_to_class</code>) <code>FlatPages</code> to get the information somewhere other than the database I'd prefer that. Maybe the metadata can be inserted to the templates and then a special manager that reads this data would replace the default manager of <code>FlatPages</code>.</p>

<p>If I don't prefer manual editing over admin functionality for flatpages, how can take the database out of the equation?</p>

<p>I'm trying solve the sliding puzzle problem (where you have 9 slots and 8 tiles arranged in a square) using a*, depth first, and breadth first search algorithm.  I did this ~11 years ago in some AI class in Lisp, but basically at the time I had no idea about lisp, I hated it with all my heart, and only in retrospect do I realize I was programming ""C"" in Lisp.  The prof didn't help in this matter.</p>

<p>I have a python function which can swap two tiles easily:  </p>

<pre><code>def swap(p, (r1, c1), (r2, c2)):  
    # Swaps *any* two locations and returns new configuration  
    # Does not concern itself with zero location, etc  
    # Not sure how to do this functionally  
    p_p = p[:]  
    temp = p_p[r1][c1]  
    p_p[r1][c1] = p_p[r2][c2]  
    p_p[r2][c2] = temp  
    return p_p  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to turn this into something you might find in SICP, avoiding side effects, etc.  </p>

<p>But this brings up a question.  Everything I read in SICP is loops via recursion.  I didn't see anything in accessing arrays/vectors/lists in constant time.  I can imagine a loopish/recursive way to read an element, but I find it harder to imagine a way to create a new list with a certain element changed, without invoking side-effect producing things like set!, and without resorting to crazy if/then/else clauses concerning which element should be changed.  This of course gets more confusing when considering a 2d array.  In this case the solution with python is obvious because of its native support for multidimensional arrays.</p>

<p>In C/C++/Python/Matlab/Lua/anything else, accessing lists/arrays via the [i] syntax is easy, and directly translates to a hardware-oriented pointer lookup somewhere underneath.  I don't understand how scheme does this, given the atomic operations defined in the SICP version of scheme, which all seem very loop-and-search oriented.  How do the vector and list array access functions work to get constant time access?  (I'm a total newbie here, so I'm not ever sure what functions I'd be talking about).  Is there a C or Assembly library someplace which is secretly being accessed?  Are there any inherent constant-time semantics in scheme which could be used for list/array/vector access, and which would allow me a guilt-free way of using that idiom in Python for the moment?  </p>

<p>How would can I rewrite the above function in python using Schemish semantics?  How would I rewrite the above function in Scheme?</p>

1596,347109,37984.0,2008-12-07T01:59:49Z,14,How do I concisely implement multiple similar unit tests in the Python unittest framework?,"<p>I'm implementing unit tests for a family of functions that all share a number of invariants. For example, calling the function with two matrices produce a matrix of known shape.</p>

<p>I would like to write unit tests to test the entire family of functions for this property, without having to write an individual test case for each function (particularly since more functions might be added later). </p>

<p>One way to do this would be to iterate over a list of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
import numpy

from somewhere import the_functions
from somewhere.else import TheClass

class Test_the_functions(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.matrix1 = numpy.ones((5,10))
    self.matrix2 = numpy.identity(5)

  def testOutputShape(unittest.TestCase):
     """"""Output of functions be of a certain shape""""""
     for function in all_functions:
       output = function(self.matrix1, self.matrix2)
       fail_message = ""%s produces output of the wrong shape"" % str(function)
       self.assertEqual(self.matrix1.shape, output.shape, fail_message)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>I got the idea for this from <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/unit_testing/romantest.html"">Dive Into Python</a>. There, it's not a list of functions being tested but a list of known input-output pairs. The problem with this approach is that if any element of the list fails the test, the later elements don't get tested.</p>

<p>I looked at subclassing unittest.TestCase and somehow providing the specific function to test as an argument, but as far as I can tell that prevents us from using unittest.main() because there would be no way to pass the argument to the testcase.</p>

<p>I also looked at dynamically attaching ""testSomething"" functions to the testcase, by using setattr with a lamdba, but the testcase did not recognize them.</p>

<p>How can I rewrite this so it remains trivial to expand the list of tests, while still ensuring every test is run?</p>

1598,347497,745.0,2008-12-07T11:41:34Z,3,Emitting headers from a tiny Python web-framework,"<p>I am writing a web-framework for Python, of which the goal is to be as ""small"" as possible (currently under 100 lines of code).. You can see the current code <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/pyerweb/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">on github</a></p>

<p>Basically it's written to be as simple to use as possible. An example ""Hello World"" like site:</p>

<pre><code>from pyerweb import GET, runner

@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return ""&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; would be the output HTML for the URL / ""

@GET(""/view/([0-9]+?)$"")
def view_something(id):
    return ""Viewing id %s"" % (id) # URL /view/123 would output ""Viewing id 123""

runner(url = ""/"", # url would be from a web server, in actual use
       output_helper = ""html_tidy"" # run returned HTML though ""HTML tidy""
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you have a function that returns HTML, and the GET decorator maps this to a URL.</p>

<p>When <code>runner()</code> is called, each decorated function is checked, if the URL regex matches the request URL, the function is run, and the output is sent to the browser.</p>

<p>Now, the problem - outputting headers. Currently for development I've just put a line before the <code>runner()</code> call which does <code>print Content-type:text/html\n</code> - this is obviously a bit limiting..</p>

<p>My first ideas was to have the functions return a dict, something like..</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return {
        ""html"": ""&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"",
        ""headers"": {""Location"":""http://google.com""}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like this - having to return a dict with a specifically named key isn't nearly as nice as just returning a string..</p>

<p>I could check if the returned data is a dict, if so use <code>returned_data['html']</code> as the output, if it's a string, there is no custom headers to be sent... but this means to go from no headers (which would be the case a huge majority of the time) to headers, you'd have to change the return function from <code>return my_html</code> to <code>return {'html':my_html}</code> which isn't very elegant either..</p>

<p>After writing this, I discovered ""Sinatra"" - a similar-in-use Ruby library, and looked at how it dealt with headers:</p>

<pre><code>get ""/"" do
    content_type 'text/css', :charset =&gt; 'utf-8'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like it could be nice enough in Python:</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    header(""location"", ""http://google.com"")
</code></pre>

<p>To implement this, I was considering changing how the functions are executed - instead of simply using the return value, I would change <code>sys.stdout</code> to a StringIO, so you could do..</p>

<pre><code>def index():
    print ""&lt;html&gt;""
    print ""&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Something&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;""
    print ""&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;""
    print ""&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>..without having to worry about concatenating a bunch of strings together. The upshot of this is I could have a separate stream for headers, so the above <code>header()</code> function would write to this.. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def header(name, value):
    pyerweb.header_stream.write(""%s: %s"" % (name, value))
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the question is, how would you output headers from this web-framework (mostly in terms of <em>use</em>, but to a lesser extent implementation)?</p>

<p>n is usually no greater than 10 and the list usually has around 20000 elements. The list is always different each time I call the function. Sorting can't be made in place.</p>

<p>Initially, I have written this function:</p>

<pre><code>def mins(items, n):
    mins = [float('inf')]*n
    for item in items:
        for i, min in enumerate(mins):
	        if item &lt; min:
		        mins.insert(i, item)
		        mins.pop()
		        break
    return mins
</code></pre>

<p>But this function can't beat a simple sorted(items)[:n] which sort the entire list. Here is my test:</p>

<pre><code>from random import randint, random
import time

test_data = [randint(10, 50) + random() for i in range(20000)]

init = time.time()
mins = mins(test_data, 8)
print 'mins(items, n):', time.time() - init

init = time.time()
mins = sorted(test_data)[:8]
print 'sorted(items)[:n]:', time.time() - init

<p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>mins(items, n): 0.0632939338684
sorted(items)[:n]: 0.0231449604034
</code></pre>

<p>sorted()[:n] is three times faster. I believe this is because:</p>

<ol>
<li>insert() operation is costly because Python lists are not linked lists.</li>
<li>sorted() is an optimized c function and mine is pure python.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any way to beat sorted()[:n] ?

I learnt Haskell before I learnt Python, so I've always been fond of thinking of many computations as a mapping onto a list. This is beautifully expressed by a list comprehension (I'm giving the pythonic version here):</p>

<pre><code>result = [ f(x) for x in list ]

<p>In many cases though, we want to execute more than a single statement on x, say:</p>

<pre><code>result = [ f(g(h(x))) for x in list ]

<p>My normal solution to this is to expand this back into a for loop:</p>

<pre><code>result = []
for x in list:
  x0 = h(x)
  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)
  result.append(x2)

<p>One thing about this that bothers me no end is having to initialize the empty list 'result'. It's a triviality, but it makes me unhappy. I was wondering if there were any alternative equivalent forms. One way may be to use a local function(is that what they're called in Python?)</p>

  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)

However, I'm still unclear how apps inside a site interact with one another.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I'm writing a blog application (a rather popular activity, apparently). Blog posts and comments tend to go together, and yet they are distinct enough that they should be built into separate apps, as is the general philosophy of Djano development.</p>

<p>Consider the following example. In reality I would not actually write the comment app myself, as good code for that already exists on the web, but this is for demonstration/practice purposes:</p>

<p><strong>mysite/blog/models.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()

from mysite.blog.models import post

class comment(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField()
    post = models.ForeignKey(post)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
Per the recommendation in one response, I'm reading the documentation for contrib.contenttypes. If I'm reading this correctly, I could rewrite my example comment app like this:  </p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models  
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.contrib.contentypes import generic

class comment(models.Model):  
    id = models.AutoField()  
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
    text = models.TextField()  
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)  
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey(content_type, id)  
</code></pre>

<p>Would this be correct?</p>

<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. </p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, </p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>

<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"">mutable</a>, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/"">implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces</a>, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning. </p>

<p>So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?</p>

<p>for your reference:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmrNH.jpg"" alt=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmrNH.jpg""></p>

<p>database entries 1,2 and 3 are made using jython 2.2.1 using jdbc1.2.
database entry 4 is made using vb the old to be replace program using odbc.</p>

<p>We have found that if I copy and paste both jython and vb MailBody entries to wordpad directly from that SQL Server Enterprise Manager software it outputs the format perfectly with correct line returns. if I compare the bytes of each file with a hex editor or KDiff3 they are binary identically the same.</p>

<p>There is a 3rd party program which consumes this data. Sadly that 3rd party program reads the data and for entries 1 to 3 it displays the data without line returns. though for entry 4 it correctly formats the text. As futher proof we can see in the picture, the data in the database is displayed differently.
Somehow the line returns are preserved in the database for the vb entries but the jython entries they are overlooked. if I click on the 'MailBody' field of entry 4 i can press down i can see the rest of the email. Whereas the data for jython is displayed in one row.</p>

<p>What gives, what am i missing, and how do I handle this?
Here is a snippet of the code where I actually send it to the database.</p>

<p>EDIT: FYI: please disregard the discrepancies in the 'Processed' column, it is irrelevant.
EDIT: what i want to do is make the jython program input the data in the same way as the vb program. So that the 3rd party program will come along and correctly display the data.
so what it will look like is every entry in 'MailBody' will display ""This is a testing only!"" then next line ""etc etc"" so if I was to do a screendump all entries would resemble database entry 4.</p>

<p>If not, what would be the best way to handle such situations?</p>

<p>For an example I made up a color class. <em>This class should only work as a basic example to discuss this</em>, there is lot's of unnecessary and/or redundant stuff in there.</p>

<p>It would be nice, if I could call the constructor with different objects (a list, an other color object or three integers...) and the constructor handles them accordingly. In this basic example it works in some cases with * args and * * kwargs, but using class methods is the only general way I came up with. What would be a ""<strong>best practice</strong>"" like solution for this?</p>

<p>The constructor aside, if I would like to implement an _ _ <strong>add</strong> _ _ method too, how can I get this method to accept all of this: A plain integer (which is added to all values), three integers (where the first is added to the red value and so forth) or another color object (where both red values are added together, etc.)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I added an <em>alternative</em> constructor (initializer, _ _ <strong>init</strong> _ _) that basicly does all the stuff I wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>But I stick with the first one and the factory methods. Seems clearer.</p></li>
<li><p>I also added an _ _ <strong>add</strong> _ _, which does all the things mentioned above but I'm not sure if it's <em>good style</em>. I try to use the iteration protocol and fall back to ""single value mode"" instead of checking for specific types. Maybe still ugly tho.</p></li>
<li><p>I have taken a look at _ _ <strong>new</strong> _ _, thanks for the links.</p></li>
<li><p>My first quick try with it fails: I filter the rgb values from the * args and * * kwargs (is it a class, a list, etc.) then call the superclass's _ _ new _ _ with the right args (just r,g,b) to pass it along to init. The call to the 'Super(cls, self)._ _ new _ _ (....)' works, but since I generate and return the same object as the one I call from (as intended), all the original args get passed to _ _ init _ _ (working as intended), so it bails. </p></li>
<li><p>I could get rid of the _ _ init _ _ completly and set the values in the _ _ new _ _ but I don't know... feels like I'm abusing stuff here ;-) I should take a good look at metaclasses and new first I guess.</p></li>

<p>I have basically this:</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
</code></pre>

<p>and then I want to spawn another process, I don't care about this one anymore, whether it ended or not.</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command2')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
</code></pre>

<p>And the code is hanging at the second ""spawn""</p>

<p>However, if I comment out the first call, the second one works, so i'm guessing that the fact that the first one is still running or something is keeping it from working.</p>

<p>Now, the other thing I haven't been able to do is wait until the first one stops.
I've tried:<br />
child.close() - it hangs (both with True and False as parameters)
child.read(-1) - it hangs<br />
child.expect(pexpect.EOF) - it hangs.<br />
child.terminate() - it hangs  (both with True and False as parameters)</p>

<p>Any ideas on what could be happening?<br />
NOTE: I'm not a Python expert, and i have never used pexpect before, so ANY idea is more than welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>UPDATE: This is definitely related to ssh-copy-id, because with other processes, spawn works well even if they don't return.
Also, apparently ssh-copy-id never returns an EOF.</p>

1653,357656,2010.0,2008-12-10T21:25:18Z,10,Proper way of cancelling accept and closing a Python processing/multiprocessing Listener connection,"<p>(I'm using the <a href=""http://developer.berlios.de/projects/pyprocessing"" rel=""nofollow"">pyprocessing</a> module in this example, but replacing processing with multiprocessing should probably work if you run <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">python 2.6</a> or use the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/"" rel=""nofollow"">multiprocessing backport</a>)</p>

<p>I currently have a program that listens to a unix socket (using a processing.connection.Listener), accept connections and spawns a thread handling the request. At a certain point I want to quit the process gracefully, but since the accept()-call is blocking and I see no way of cancelling it in a nice way. I have one way that works here (OS X) at least, setting a signal handler and signalling the process from another thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>import processing
from processing.connection import Listener
import threading
import time
import os
import signal
import socket
import errno

# This is actually called by the connection handler.
def closeme():
    time.sleep(1)
    print 'Closing socket...'
    listener.close()
    os.kill(processing.currentProcess().getPid(), signal.SIGPIPE)

oldsig = signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, lambda s, f: None)

listener = Listener('/tmp/asdf', 'AF_UNIX')
# This is a thread that handles one already accepted connection, left out for brevity
threading.Thread(target=closeme).start()
print 'Accepting...'
try:
    listener.accept()
except socket.error, e:
    if e.args[0] != errno.EINTR:
        raise
# Cleanup here...
print 'Done...'
</code></pre>

<p>The only other way I've thought about is reaching deep into the connection (listener._listener._socket) and setting the non-blocking option...but that probably has some side effects and is generally really scary.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a more elegant (and perhaps even correct!) way of accomplishing this? It needs to be portable to OS X, Linux and BSD, but Windows portability etc is not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>:
Thanks all! As usual, ambiguities in my original question are revealed :)</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to perform cleanup after I have cancelled the listening, and I don't always want to actually exit that process.</li>
<li>I need to be able to access this process from other processes not spawned from the same parent, which makes Queues unwieldy</li>
<li>The reasons for threads are that:
<ul>
<li>They access a shared state. Actually more or less a common in-memory database, so I suppose it could be done differently.</li>
<li>I must be able to have several connections accepted at the same time, but the actual threads are blocking for something most of the time. Each accepted connection spawns a new thread; this in order to not block all clients on I/O ops.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding threads vs. processes, I use threads for making my blocking ops non-blocking and processes to enable multiprocessing.</p>

For example I have cases where u'(2'.  This exists because for formatting reasons the closing paren ends up in an adjacent html cell.  My initial solution to this problem was to look ahead at the contents of the next cell and using a string function determine if it held the closing paren.  I knew this was not a great solution but it worked.  Now I want to fix it but I can't seem to make the regular expression work.   </p>

<pre><code>missingParen=re.compile(r""^\(\d[^\)]$"")
</code></pre>

<p>My understanding of what I think I am doing:<br />
^ at the beginning of the string I want to find<br />
( an open paren, the paren has to be backslashed because it is a special character<br />
\d I also want to find a single digit<br />
[ I am creating a special character class<br />
^ I don't want to find what follows<br />
) which is a close paren<br />
$ at the end of the string  </p>

<p>And of course the plot thickens I made a silly assumption that because I placed a \d I would not find (33 but I am wrong so I added a {1} to my regular expression and that did not help, it matched (3333, so my problem is more complicated than I thought.  I want the string to be only an open paren and a single digit.  Is this the more clever approach </p>

There must be an open paren to start<br />
There may or may not be as many as one dollar sign<br />
The next group must exist at least once but can exist an unlimited number of times<br />
The group should have at least one digit but may have as many as three<br />
The group may have as few as 0 and as many as 1 commas<br />
Following this group there may or may not be a decimal point<br />
If there is a decimal point it will  be followed by as many as 0 but as many as uncounted occurences of digits<br />
At the end there should not be a closing paren.</p>

The situation is something like this. If I have a db with schema A and it stores data for a feature in say, 5 tables. Schema A -> Schema B is done during an upgrade process.

 What i'm after is some way to verify data integrity, basically i would have to compare different schemas while factoring in the transformation logic. Short of writing some custom t-sql sprocs to compare the data, is there an alternate method? I'm leaning towards python to automate this, are there any python modules that would help me out?

I've been using <code>python-mode.el</code> for something like ten years, so perhaps I'm a little set in my ways.  I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's carefully evaluated the two modes, in particular of the pros and cons they perceive of each and how their work generally interacts with the features specific to <code>python.el</code>.</p>

<p>The two major issues for me with <code>python.el</code> were </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each buffer visiting a python file gets its own inferior interactive python shell.  I am used to doing development in one interactive shell and sharing data between python files.  (Might seem like bad practice from a software-engineering perspective, but I'm usually working with huge datasets which take a while to load into memory.)</p></li>
<li><p>The skeleton-mode support in python.el, which seemed absolutely gratuitous (python's syntax makes such automation unnecessary) and badly designed (for instance, it has no knowledge of ""<code>for</code>"" loop generator expressions or ""<code>&lt;expr 1&gt; if &lt;cond&gt; else &lt;expr 2&gt;</code>"" expressions, so you have to go back and remove the colons it helpfully inserts after insisting that you enter the expression clauses in the minibuffer.)  I couldn't figure out how to turn it off.  There was a <code>python.el</code> variable which claimed to control this, but it didn't seem to work.  It could be that the version of <code>python.el</code> I was using was broken (it came from the debian emacs-snapshot package) so if anyone knows of an up-to-date version of it, I'd like to hear about it.  (I had the same problem with the version in CVS emacs as of approximately two weeks ago.)</p></li>

<p>When the user returns (events come in again), I wait a moment (so this doesn't get triggered by the cleaning crew or your pets or an earthquake).

The records I am outputting are usually going to be just a last name, first name, and room code.  I</p>

<p>I would <em>like</em> to output a series of pages, each containing a contiguous subset of the total records, divided into multiple columns, each of which contains a contiguous subset of the total records on the page.  (So in other words, you'd read down the first column, move to the next column, move to the next column, etc., and then start over on the next page...)</p>

<p>The problem I am facing now is that for output formats, I'm almost certainly limited to HTML (and Javascript, CSS, etc.)  What is the best way to get the data into this columnar format?  If I knew for certain that the printable area of the paper would hold 20 records vertically and five horizontally, for instance, I could easily print tables of 5x20, but I don't know if there's a way to indicate a page break -- and I don't know if there's any way to calculate programmatically how many records will fit on the page.</p>

<p>How would you approach this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  The reason I said that I was limited in output:  I have to produce the file on one computer, then bring it to a different computer upon which we cannot install new software and on which the selection of existing software is not optimal.  The file itself is only going to be used to make a physical printout (which is what the end users will actually work with), but my time on the computer that I can print from is going to be limited, so I need to have the file all ready to go and print right away without a lot of tweaking.</p>

<p>Right now I've managed to find a word processor that I can use on the target machine, so I'm going to see if I can target a format that the word processor uses.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Once I knew there was a word processor I could use, I made a simple skeleton file with the settings that I wanted (column and tab settings, monospaced font in a small point size, etc.) and then measured how many characters I got per line of a column and how many lines I got per column.  I've watched the runs pretty carefully to make sure that there weren't some strange lines that somehow overflowed the characters-per-line guideline (which shouldn't happen with monospaced font, of course, but how many times do you end up having to figure out why that thing that ""shouldn't"" happen is happening anyways?)</p>

<p>If there hadn't been a word processor on the target machine that I could use, I probably would have looked at PDF as an output format.</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int add(int x, int y) {
    int a, b;
    do {
        a = x &amp; y;
        b = x ^ y;
        x = a &lt;&lt; 1;
        y = b;
    } while (a);
    return b;
}

int main( void ){
    printf( ""6 + 3 = %d"", add(6,3));
    printf( ""6 - 3 = %d"", add(6,-3));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works great and I then ported it to Python as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def add(x, y):
    while True:
        a = x &amp; y
        b = x ^ y
        x = a &lt;&lt; 1
        y = b
        if a == 0:
            break
    return b

print ""6 + 3 = %d"" % add(6,3)
print ""6 - 3 = %d"" % add(6,-3)
</code></pre>

<p>They both work for addition and the C program works for subtraction as well.  However, the Python program enters an infinite loop for subtraction.  I am trying to get to the bottom of this and have posted the program here for further experimentation: <a href=""http://codepad.org/pb8IuLnY"">http://codepad.org/pb8IuLnY</a></p>

For instance, if you try saving a string as an IntegerProperty, that will result in an error.</p>

<p>The one exception (no pun intended) is ReferenceProperty. If you have lots of references and you're not completely careful about leaving in bad references, it's common to be greeted with an error like ""TemplateSyntaxError: Caught an exception while rendering: ReferenceProperty failed to be resolved"".</p>

<p>And this is if there's only one bad reference in the view. D'oh. </p>

<p>I could write a try/except block to try to access all the reference properties and delete them if an exception is raised, but this functionality could surely be useful to many other developers if there was a more generic method than the one I'd be capable of writing. I imagine it would take a list of model types and try to access each reference property of each entity in each model, setting the property to None if an exception is raised.</p>

<p>I'll see if I can do this myself, but it would definitely help to have some suggestions/snippets to get me started.</p>

1721,368636,18866.0,2008-12-15T15:06:49Z,20,Questions about Setuptools and alternatives,"<p>I've seen a good bit of setuptools bashing on the internets lately. Most recently, I read James Bennett's <a href=""http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/14/packaging/"">On packaging</a> post on why no one should be using setuptools. From my time in #python on Freenode, I know that there are a few souls there who absolutely detest it. I would count myself among them, but I do actually use it.</p>

<p>I've used setuptools for enough projects to be aware of its deficiencies, and I would prefer something better. I don't particularly like the egg format and how it's deployed. With all of setuptools' problems, I haven't found a better alternative.</p>

<p>My understanding of tools like <a href=""http://pip.openplans.org/"">pip</a> is that it's meant to be an easy_install replacement (not setuptools). In fact, pip uses some setuptools components, right?</p>

<p>Most of my packages make use of a setuptools-aware setup.py, which declares all of the dependencies. When they're ready, I'll build an sdist, bdist, and bdist_egg, and upload them to pypi.</p>

<p>If I wanted to switch to using pip, what kind of changes would I need to make to rid myself of easy_install dependencies? Where are the dependencies declared? I'm guessing that I would need to get away from using the egg format, and provide just source distributions. If so, how do i generate the egg-info directories? or do I even need to?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of virtualenv? Doesn't virtualenv use easy_install to manage the environments?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of the setuptools provided ""develop"" command? Should I not use that? What's the alternative?</p>

<p>I'm basically trying to get a picture of what my development workflow will look like.</p>

<p>Before anyone suggests it, I'm not looking for an OS-dependent solution. I'm mainly concerned with debian linux, but deb packages are not an option, for the reasons Ian Bicking outlines <a href=""http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/12/14/a-few-corrections-to-on-packaging/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise I guess I'll create a new rrule and access _dtstart, _count, _byweekday etc. of the original instance.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've thought about it more, and I think what I should be doing is omitting the 'count' argument when I create the first rrule instance. I can still get ten occurrences the first time I use the rrule</p>

<pre><code>instances = list(r[0:10])

<p>and then afterwards I can get more </p>

I've found mod_wsgi 2.0+ to be the easiest to work with, because of easy workarounds for python module reloading. Problem is can't get it to compile on Leopard. Is there anyone who has managed to do it so far, either for the builtin Apache or MAMP. I'd be grateful if someone posts a link to a precompiled binary (for intel, python 2.5, apache 2.2 or 2.0).</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>After 3 hours of trial and error I've managed to compile mod_wsgi 2.3 for the Apache that comes with Leopard. Here are the instructions in case anyone else needs this.</p>

<ol>
<li>./configure</li>
<li><p>Change 2 lines in the Makefile</p>

<p>CFLAGS =  -Wc,'-arch i386'</p>

<p>LDFLAGS =  -arch i386 -Wl,-F/Library/Frameworks -framework Python -u _PyMac_Error</p></li>
<li><p>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</p></li>
<li><p>Make a thin binary of the original httpd</p>

<p>cd /usr/sbin </p>

<p>sudo mv ./httpd ./httpd.fat </p>

<p>sudo lipo ./httpd.fat -thin i386 -output ./httpd.i386 </p>

<p>sudo ln -s ./httpd.i386 ./httpd</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This should work on intel macbook, macbook pro, imac and mac mini. As I understood the problem is modwsgi won't compile against MacPython 2.5.2 because of some weird architecture missmatch problem. But, if you compile it as a thin binary it won't play with the Apache fat binary. So this hack solves the problem. The rest is pretty standard configuration, like on any other platform.</p>

Currently the data set is already so large that to read into my machine memory I have to at least split it in half so computing overhead is a concern.  My OOP classes create new objects (in this case I will need 250,000 new objects, each object is an array of 1,000 doubles) to handle the data.  What is the overhead in terms of memory and computing required in creating objects for a generic OOP language?  In python?  What about in C++?</p>

<p>Yes, I realize I could make a new class that is an array.  But 1) I already have these classes finished and 2) I put each object that I create back into an array for access later anyways.  The question is pedagogical </p>

<p>*update:  I want to be efficient with time, my time and the computers. I don't want to rewrite a program I already have if I don't have to and spending time optimizing the code wastes my time, I don't care <em>that</em> much if I waste the computers time.  I actually do have a 64bit machine with 4Gig ram.  The data is an image and I need to do several filters on each pixel.*</p>

Well here's something interesting some of the ftps we tested on appear to automatically allocate the space once the transfer starts.</p>

<p>E.g. If i transfer a 200mb file to the ftp server. While the transfer is active if i connect to the ftp server and do a size while the upload is happening. It shows 200mb for the size. Even though the file is only like 10% complete.</p>

<p>Permissions also seem to be randomly set the FTP Server that comes with IIS sets the permissions AFTER the file is finished copying. While some of the other older ftp servers set it as soon as you send the file.</p>

As the string concatenation has seen large boosts in performance, is this (becoming more) a stylistic decision rather than a practical one?</p>

<pre><code>DOMAIN = 'http://stackoverflow.com'
QUESTIONS = '/questions'

def so_question_uri_sub(q_num):
    return ""%s%s/%d"" % (DOMAIN, QUESTIONS, q_num)

def so_question_uri_cat(q_num):
    return DOMAIN + QUESTIONS + '/' + str(q_num)

<p>Edit: There have also been suggestions about joining a list of strings and for using named substitution. These are variants on the central theme, which is, which way is the Right Way to do it at which time? Thanks for the responses!</p>

I would like to standardize on something as I seem to be using a few different styles throughout. It seems hard to make asynchronous code simple; I suppose this is because asynchronous operations are anything but.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, the user of the API must be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have data pushed to them as it becomes available
<li>Check the status of the asynchronous operation
<li>Be notified of errors that occur
<li>Wait for completion (converting the asynchronous operation to a synchronous one)
</ol>

<p>My classes support several asynchronous operations. I have been putting some of the status/error callbacks in the class around it, but the class is becoming gunked up with a lot of incidental fields, as well as getting too large. I am curious if anyone has used an asynchronous API they found to be well-organized. I have looked at .NET's Begin/EndAsyncOperation + AsyncResult design, as well as some classes in Java (e.g. Future).</p>

<p>This is being written in Python, so it remains very flexible. There is a caveat: some of these asynchronous operations are being marshaled to a remote machine and executed over there. Thus, not every operation necessarily executes in a separate thread.</p>

I'm trying to compare really big lists of dictionaries to each other based on the dictionary values. I compare two lists, with the first like so</p>

<pre><code>biglist1=[{'transaction':'somevalue', 'id':'somevalue', 'date':'somevalue' ...}, {'transactio':'somevalue', 'id':'somevalue', 'date':'somevalue' ...}, ...]
</code></pre>

<p>With 'somevalue' standing for a user-generated string, int or decimal. Now, the second list is pretty similar, except the id-values are always empty, as they have not been assigned yet.</p>

<pre><code>biglist2=[{'transaction':'somevalue', 'id':'', 'date':'somevalue' ...}, {'transactio':'somevalue', 'id':'', 'date':'somevalue' ...}, ...]

<p>So I want to get a list of the dictionaries in biglist2 that match the dictionaries in biglist1 for all other keys <em>except</em> id.</p>

<p>I've been doing </p>

<pre><code>for item in biglist2:
    for transaction in biglist1:
       if item['transaction'] == transaction['transaction']:
          list_transactionnamematches.append(transaction)

    for transaction in list_transactionnamematches:
       if item['date'] == transaction['date']:
          list_transactionnamematches.append(transaction)

<p>... and so on, not comparing id values, until I get a final list of matches. Since the lists can be really big (around 3000+ items each), this takes quite some time for python to loop through.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this isn't really how this kind of comparison should be done. Any ideas?</p>

This is my first experience with ctypes and the first time I have had to deal with C datatypes in over a year so there is a fair learning curve here, but I think even without that this particular declaration would be troublesome:</p>

<pre><code>extern SANE_Status sane_get_devices (const SANE_Device *** device_list, SANE_Bool local_only);
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, I've successfully dealt with <code>SANE_Status</code> (an enum) and <code>SANE_Bool</code> (a typedef to <code>c_int</code>).  Those were both simple.  That first parameter, on the other hand, is causing me all sorts of grief.  I'm unfamiliar with the ""<code>***</code>"" notation to begin with and my tracer bullets so far have yielded nothing more than garbage data.  How do I format the input to this function such that I can read back a list of my Python structure-objects?  For reference, the C structure being referenced is:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    SANE_String_Const name; /* unique device name */
    SANE_String_Const vendor;   /* device vendor string */
    SANE_String_Const model;    /* device model name */
    SANE_String_Const type; /* device type (e.g., ""flatbed scanner"") */
 }
SANE_Device;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>SANE_String_Const</code> is defined as a <code>c_char_p</code>.</p>

<p>My Python/ctypes version of this object is:</p>

<pre><code>class SANE_Device(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        (""name"", c_char_p),
        (""vendor"", c_char_p),
        (""model"", c_char_p),
        (""type"", c_char_p)]
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions on what I should pass in such that I can get the expected behavior (a list of structure-objects) out of this?  All responses appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>Using the following, I was able to retrieve a correct SANE_Device Python structure:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer(SANE_Device())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents.name
</code></pre>

<p>However, 1) yuck and 2) that seems like it would only work if there is a single result.  I can't len() on <code>devices.contents.contents</code> or <code>devices.contents.contents.contents</code>.  How am I to determine the number of results?  The SANE docs specify that ""If the function executes successfully, it stores a pointer to a NULL terminated array of pointers to SANE_Device structures in *device_list"".  Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>I was able to pass an ten-item array and then access the first element using:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer((SANE_Device * 10)())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents[0].name
</code></pre>

<p>However, ten is obviously an arbitrary number and I have no way of determining the actual number of results.  Trying to access <code>devices.contents.contents.contents[1].name</code> when only one device is connected causes a segmentation fault.  There must be a proper way of dealing with variable-length constructs like these in ctypes.</p>

When we make an HTTP request from the client to the service, one call consistently raises a socket.error in socket.py, in read:</p>

<pre>(104, 'Connection reset by peer')</pre>

<p>When I listen in with wireshark, the ""good"" and ""bad"" responses look very similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because of the size of the OAuth header, the request is split into two packets.  The service responds to both with ACK</li>
<li>The service sends the response, one packet per header (HTTP/1.0 200 OK, then the Date header, etc.).  The client responds to each with ACK.</li>
<li>(Good request) the server sends a FIN, ACK.  The client responds with a FIN, ACK.  The server responds ACK.</li>
<li>(Bad request) the server sends a RST, ACK, the client doesn't send a TCP response, the socket.error is raised on the client side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the web service and the client are running on a Gentoo Linux x86-64 box running glibc-2.6.1.  We're using Python 2.5.2 inside the same virtual_env.</p>

<p>The client is a Django 1.0.2 app that is calling httplib2 0.4.0 to make requests.  We're signing requests with the OAuth signing algorithm, with the OAuth token always set to an empty string.</p>

<p>The service is running Werkzeug 0.3.1, which is using Python's wsgiref.simple_server.  I ran the WSGI app through wsgiref.validator with no issues.</p>

<p>It seems like this should be easy to debug, but when I trace through a good request on the service side, it looks just like the bad request, in the socket._socketobject.close() function, turning delegate methods into dummy methods.  When the send or sendto (can't remember which) method is switched off, the FIN or RST is sent, and the client starts processing.</p>

<p>""Connection reset by peer"" seems to place blame on the service, but I don't trust httplib2 either.  Can the client be at fault?</p>

<p>** Further debugging - Looks like server on Linux **</p>

<p>I have a MacBook, so I tried running the service on one and the client website on the other.  The Linux client calls the OS X server without the bug (FIN ACK).  The OS X client calls the Linux service with the bug (RST ACK, and a (54, 'Connection reset by peer')).  So, it looks like it's the service running on Linux.  Is it x86_64? A bad glibc? wsgiref? Still looking...</p>

<p>** Further testing - wsgiref looks flaky **</p>

<p>We've gone to production with Apache and mod_wsgi, and the connection resets have gone away.  See my answer below, but my advice is to log the connection reset and retry.  This will let your server run OK in development mode, and solidly in production.</p>

1815,384291,,2008-12-21T09:40:28Z,0,Code refactoring help - how to reorganize validations,"<p>We have a web application that takes user inputs or database lookups to form some operations against some physical resources. The design can be simply presented as following diagram:</p>

<p>user input &lt;=> model object &lt;=> database storage</p>

<p>validations are needed with request coming from user input but NOT when coming from database lookup hits (since if a record exists, those attributes must have already been validated before). I am trying to refactoring the code so that the validations happen in the object constructor instead of the old way (a separate few validation routines)</p>

<p>How would you decide which way is better? (The fundamental difference of method 1 (the old way) and 2 is that validations in 1 are not mandatory and decoupled from object instantiation but 2 binds them and makes them mandatory for all requests)</p>

<p>Here are two example code snippets for design 1 and 2:</p>

<p>Method 1:</p>

<pre><code># For processing single request.
# Steps: 1. Validate all incoming data. 2. instantiate the object.
ValidateAttribures(request) # raise Exceptions if failed
resource = Resource(**request)
</code></pre>

<p>Method 2:</p>

<pre><code># Have to extract out this since it does not have anything to do with
# the object.
# raise Exceptions if some required params missing.
# steps: 1. Check whether its a batching request. 2. instantiate the object.
#           (validations are performed inside the constructor)
CheckIfBatchRequest(request) 
resource = Resource(**request) # raise Exceptions when validations failed
</code></pre>

<p>In a batch request:
Method 1:</p>

<pre><code># steps: 1. validate each request and return error to the client if any found.
#        2. perform the object instantiate and creation process. Exceptions are
#           captured.
#        3. when all finished, email out any errors.
for request in batch_requests:
    try:    
        ValidateAttribute(request)
    except SomeException, e:
        return ErrorPage(e)
errors = []
for request in batch_requests:
    try:
        CreatResource(Resource(**request), request)
    except CreationError, e:
        errors.append('failed to create with error: %s', e)
email(errors)
</code></pre>

<p>Method 2:</p>

<pre><code># steps: 1. validate batch job related data from the request.
#        2. If success, create objects for each request and do the validations.
#        3. If exception, return error found, otherwise, 
#           return a list of pairs with (object, request)
#        4. Do the creation process and email out any errors if encountered.
CheckIfBatchRequest(request)
request_objects = []
for request in batch_requests:
    try:
        resource = Resource(**request)
    except SomeException, e:
        return ErrorPage(e)
    request_objects.append((resource, request))
email(CreateResource(request_objects)) # the CreateResource will also need to be refactored.
</code></pre>

<p>Pros and Cons as I can see here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Method 1 follows more close to the business logic. No redundant validations check when objects come from db lookup. The validation routines are better maintainable and read.</li>
<li>Method 2 makes easy and clean for the caller. Validations are mandatory even if from db lookup. Validations are less maintainable and read.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd like to inform the user that they need to rerun the program with Python >= 2.6 and maybe provide some instructions on how to do so. However, to quote <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0236/"">PEP 236</a>:</p>

  <li>Blank lines.</li>
  <li>Other future_statements.</li>

<p>This snippet from the PEP seems to give hope of doing it inline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q:  I want to wrap future_statements
  in try/except blocks, so I can use
  different code depending on which
  version of Python I'm running.  Why
  can't I?</p>
  
  <p>A:  Sorry!  try/except is a runtime
  feature; future_statements are
  primarily compile-time gimmicks, and
  your try/except happens long after the
  compiler is done.  That is, by the
  time you do try/except, the semantics
  in effect for the module are already a
  done deal.  Since the try/except
  wouldn't accomplish what it <em>looks</em>
  like it should accomplish, it's simply
  not allowed.  We also want to keep
  these special statements very easy to
  find and to recognize.</p>
  
  <p>Note that you <em>can</em> import __future__
  directly, and use the information in
  it, along with sys.version_info, to
  figure out where the release you're
  running under stands in relation to a
  given feature's status.</p>

In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True

Just about every example I've seen don't go much beyond layouts/sizers and event handling, none really tackle project organization of a wxPython project.</p>

<p>For example, I have a method that gets a list of folders.  The way most examples would deal with this would be to stick the method right in the frame class.  This method has the potential to be used in several other parts of the application, so it would make more sense to store it at the application class level.</p>

<p>I am of the mind that you almost never need to use metaclasses. Why? because I figure if you are doing something like that to a class, you should probably be doing it to an object. And a small redesign/refactor is in order.</p>

<p>Being able to use metaclasses has caused a lot of people in a lot of places to use classes as some kind of second rate object, which just seems disastrous to me. Is programming to be replaced by meta-programming? The addition of class decorators has unfortunately made it even more acceptable.</p>

<p>So please, I am desperate to know your valid (concrete) use-cases for metaclasses in Python. Or to be enlightened as to why mutating classes is better than mutating objects, sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes when using a third-party
  library it is useful to be able to
  mutate the class in a certain way.</p>

I also didn't really like the language (that ""self"" stuff grossed me out).</p>

<p>I know that C++ is the language for the job in terms of performance, but I hate it. I don't want to deal with its sloppy syntax and I like my hand to be held by managed languages. This brings me to C# and Java, but I am open to other languages. I love the simplicity of .NET, but I was wondering if, speed wise, this would be good for the job. Keep in mind since this will be deployed on a Linux server, it would be running on the Mono framework - not sure if that matters. I know that Java is syntax-wise very similar to .Net, but my experience with it is limited. Are there any frameworks out there for it or anthing to ease in the development?</p>

<p>Please help me and my picky self arrive on a solution.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I didn't mean to sound so picky, and I really don't think I was. The only language I really excluded was C++, Python I don't like because of the scalability problem. I know that there are ways of communicating between processes, but if I have an 8 core server, why should I need to make 8 processes? Is there a more elegant solution?</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm trying to pass data to subprocess.Popen().  The process will read from stdin, but you cannot pass a ""file-like"" object to Popen because it calls stdin.fileno() and blows up unless you have a real file.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to pass the PIPE argument to Popen, which allows you to use proc.stdin as a file-like object.  But if you've already got a file-like object, there doesn't seem to be a great way to yolk the two of them together.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone here have already managed to find a workaround.</p>

<p>The problem is that due to the new changes in Python 3.0 regarding bytes and strings, not all the library code is apparently tested.</p>

<p>I have a script that downloades a page from a web server. This script passed a username and password as part of the url in python 2.6, but in Python 3.0, this doesn't work any more.</p>

<p>For instance, this:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib.request;
url = ""http://username:password@server/file"";
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, ""temp.dat"");
</code></pre>

<p>fails with this exception:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""C:\Temp\test.py"", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, ""test.html"");

    raise TypeError(""expected bytes, not %s"" % s.__class__.__name__)
TypeError: expected bytes, not str
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently, base64-encoding now needs bytes in and outputs a string, and thus urlretrieve (or some code therein) which builds up a string of username:password, and tries to base64-encode this for simple authorization, fails.</p>

<p>If I instead try to use urlopen, like this:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib.request;
url = ""http://username:password@server/file"";
f = urllib.request.urlopen(url);
contents = f.read();

<p>Then it fails with this exception:</p>

    raise InvalidURL(""nonnumeric port: '%s'"" % host[i+1:])
http.client.InvalidURL: nonnumeric port: 'password@server'
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently the url parsing in this ""next gen url retrieval library"" doesn't know what to do with username and passwords in the url.</p>

Every tutorial on setting up a Django development environment on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Leopard"" rel=""nofollow"">Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X Leopard</a> is insidiously wrong. They are all skipping over one step, or assuming you have setup something one way, or are just assuming that I know one thing that I must not.</p>

<p>I'm very familiar with how to setup the environment on Ubuntu/Linux, and the only part I'm getting stuck on with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X"" rel=""nofollow"">OS&nbsp;X</a> is how to install MySQL, autostart it, and install the Python MySQL bindings. I think my mistake was using a hodgepodge of tools I don't fully understand; I used fink to install MySQL and its development libraries and then tried to build the Python-MySQL bindings from source (but they won't build.)</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I installed the binary MySQL package from <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg</a>, and I got MySQL server running (can access with admin.)
The MySQL version I got from port was rubbish, I could not get it to run at all.</p>

<p>I modified the source for the Python-MySQL package as per the answer I chose, but I still got compilation errors that I listed in the comments. I was able to fix these by adding /usr/local/mysql/bin/ to my path in my ""~/.profile"" file.
""
PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH
""</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I was very wary about editing the source code since this operation had been so easy on Ubuntu, but I'll be more willing to try that in the future. I'm really missing Ubuntu's ""apt-get"" command; it makes life very easy and simple sometimes. I already have an Ubuntu <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware"" rel=""nofollow"">VMware</a> image running on my Mac, so I can always use that as a fallback (plus it more closely matches my production machines so should be a good test environment for debugging production problems.)</p>

<p>When and why would I have to do something like the following?</p>

<pre><code># Refer link1
return super(MyType, cls).__new__(cls, name, bases, newattrs)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code># Refer link2
return super(MetaSingleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kw)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code># Refer link2
return type(self.__name__ + other.__name__, (self, other), {})
</code></pre>

<p>How does super work exactly?</p>

<p>What is class registry and unregistry in link1 and how exactly does it work? (I thought it has something to do with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">singleton</a>. I may be wrong, being from C background. My coding style is still a mix of functional and OO).</p>

<p>What is the flow of class instantiation (subclass, metaclass, super, type) and method invocation (</p>

<pre><code>metaclass-&gt;__new__, metaclass-&gt;__init__, super-&gt;__new__, subclass-&gt;__init__ inherited from metaclass
</code></pre>

<p>) with well-commented working code (though the first link is quite close, but it does not talk about cls keyword and super(..) and registry). Preferably an example with  multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>P.S.: I made the last part as code because Stack&nbsp;Overflow formatting was converting the text <code>metaclass-&gt;__new__</code>
to metaclass-><strong>new</strong></p>

From the Zen of Python, ""There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it,"" but I see there are at least two ways:</p>

<pre><code>sorted(a) == sorted(b)

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>all(a.count(char) == b.count(char) for char in a)

<p>but the first one is slower when (for example) the first char of <code>a</code> is nowhere in <code>b</code>, and the second is slower when they are actually permutations.</p>

<p>Is there any better (either in the sense of more Pythonic, or in the sense of faster on average) way to do it? Or should I just choose from these two depending on which situation I expect to be most common?</p>

1886,396455,,2008-12-28T17:51:48Z,6,Python-PostgreSQL psycopg2 interface --> executemany,"<p>I am currently analyzing a wikipedia dump file; I am extracting a bunch of data from it using python and persisting it into a PostgreSQL db. I am always trying to make things go faster for this file is huge (18GB). In order to interface with PostgreSQL, I am using psycopg2, but this module seems to mimic many other such DBAPIs.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a question concerning cursor.executemany(command, values); it seems to me like executing an executemany once every 1000 values or so is better than calling cursor.execute(command % value) for each of these 5 million values (please confirm or correct me!).</p>

<p>But, you see, I am using an executemany to INSERT 1000 rows into a table which has a UNIQUE integrity constraint; this constraint is not verified in python beforehand, for this would either require me to SELECT all the time (this seems counter productive) or require me to get more than 3 GB of RAM. All this to say that I count on Postgres to warn me when my script tried to INSERT an already existing row via catching the psycopg2.DatabaseError. </p>

<p>When my script detects such a non-UNIQUE INSERT, it connection.rollback() (which makes ups to 1000 rows everytime, and kind of makes the executemany worthless) and then INSERTs all values one by one.</p>

<p>Since psycopg2 is so poorly documented (as are so many great modules...), I cannot find an efficient and effective workaround. I have reduced the number of values INSERTed per executemany from 1000 to 100 in order to reduce the likeliness of a non-UNIQUE INSERT per executemany, but I am pretty certain their is a way to just tell psycopg2 to ignore these execeptions or to tell the cursor to continue the executemany. </p>

<p>Basically, this seems like the kind of problem which has a solution so easy and popular, that all I can do is ask in order to learn about it.</p>

Many of the tools I build have simple windowed GUIs for the animators and modellers to use.  These GUIs often contain what you'd normally expect to see in any basic window; labels, lists, menus, buttons, textfields, etc.  However, there are limitations to the complexity of the UIs you can build with the available tools, specifically in the types of available widgets.</p>

<p>I'm interested in using some of the more advanced wxPython widgets such as the ListView (grid), Tree, etc.  This would involve using a complete wxFrame (window) to display the whole UI, which would essentially mean that window would no longer be tied to Maya.  Not a deal breaker, but it means when Maya is minimized, the window won't follow suit.</p>

<p>I've tried something like this before with tkinter as a test, but found that it needed a MainLoop to run in its own thread.  This is logical, but in my case, it conflicts with Maya's own thread, essentially making Maya hang until the window is closed.  This is due to the fact that Maya runs all scripts, be they MEL or Python, in a single thread that the main Maya GUI shares.  This is to prevent one script from, say, deleting an object while another script is trying to do work on the same object.</p>

<p>wxPython has this same ""mainloop"" methodolgy. I'm wondering if there's any way around it so that it can work within Maya?</p>

<p>In python, you can index lists using slice notation. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A = list(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

<p>You can also include a stride, which acts like a ""step"":</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5:2]
[0, 2, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>The stride is also allowed to be negative, meaning the elements are retrieved in reverse order:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[5:0:-1]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But wait!  I wanted to see <code>[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]</code>.  Oh, I see, I need to decrement the start and end indices:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4:-1:-1]
[]
</code></pre>

<p>What happened?  It's interpreting -1 as  being at the end of the array, not the beginning.  I know you can achieve this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

<p>But you can't use this in all cases.  For example, in a method that's been passed indices.  </p>

<p>Can someone please explain what the 'proper' usage ought to be for negatively selecting stuff.  I tried this in a commercial cad tool and it worked as expected, but then I've seen some SQL query examples (I think), which selected things <em>first</em>, then removed the unwanted ones.</p>

So I have this .py file that reads like:</p>

<pre><code>starting_length=9
starting_cell_size=1000
LengthofExperiments=5000000
</code></pre>

<p>Then I execute the file and get the data. Since the program is all on my machine and no one else has access to it, it is secure in a trivial way.<br>
I can also write a similar file very easily:</p>

<pre><code>def writeoptions(directory):
    options=""""
    options+=""starting_length=%s%s""%(starting_length,os.linesep)
    options+=""starting_cell_size=%s%s""%(starting_cell_size,os.linesep)
    options+=""LengthofExperiments=%s%s""%(LengthofExperiments,os.linesep)
...
    open(""%s%soptions.py""%(directory,os.sep),'w').write(options)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to pass a function as one of the parameters:</p>

<pre><code>starting_length=9
starting_cell_size=1000
LengthofExperiments=5000000

def pippo(a,b):
    return a+b
functionoperator=pippo
</code></pre>

<p>And of course in the real experiment the function pippo will be much more complex. And different from experiment to experiment.</p>

<p>But what I am unable to do is to write the function automatically. In short I don't know how to generalise the writeoptions function to keep on writing the options, if one of the options is a function. I could of course copy the original file, but this is inelegant, inefficient (because it contains a lot of extra options that are not being used), and generally does not solve the question.</p>

<p>How do you get python to write down the code of a function, as it writes down the value of a variable?</p>

Each category has a ""parent"" ForeignKey pointing back to the same Category model.  I want to allow admins to add categories, and I want the interface to allow them to select a category's parent category.  However, I want to avoid I'm-my-own-grandpa situations, so I want to limit the available choices of categories to those which do not have category in question as an ancestor.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm controlling this from the view:</p>

<pre><code>parent_candidates = list(Category.objects.all())
pruned_parent_list = [cat for cat in parent_candidates if instance.id not in cat.getHierarchy()]
</code></pre>

<p>where instance is the category being edited and getHierarchy() is a method to get a list of ancestor ids.</p>

<p>There are a number of problems with this approach.  In particular, it uses an extra database hit to get the list of all categories and it makes me write the selection mechanism into my template by looping through pruned_parent_list to get the options, when I'd really rather just specify a widget.</p>

<p>Is there any better way to do this?  I know I can add custom validation on the back-end to prevent this, but why give users the option?</p>

1911,401215,38140.0,2008-12-30T19:30:11Z,9,How to limit rate of requests to web services in Python?,"<p>I'm working on a Python library that interfaces with a web service API. Like many web services I've encountered, this one requests limiting the rate of requests. I would like to provide an optional parameter, <code>limit</code>, to the class instantiation that, if provided, will hold outgoing requests until the number of seconds specified passes.</p>

<p>I understand that the general scenario is the following: an instance of the class makes a request via a method. When it does, the method emits some signal that sets a lock variable somewhere, and begins a countdown timer for the number of seconds in <code>limit</code>. (In all likelihood, the lock is the countdown timer itself.) If another request is made within this time frame, it must be queued until the countdown timer reaches zero and the lock is disengaged; at this point, the oldest request on the queue is sent, and the countdown timer is reset and the lock is re-engaged.</p>

<p>Is this a case for threading? Is there another approach I'm not seeing?</p>

<p>Should the countdown timer and lock be instance variables, or should they belong to the class, such that all instances of the class hold requests?</p>

<p>Also, is this generally a bad idea to provide rate-limiting functionality within a library? I reason since, by default, the countdown is zero seconds, the library still allows developers to use the library and provide their own rate-limiting schemes. Given any developers using the service will need to rate-limit requests anyway, however, I figure that it would be a convenience for the library to provide a means of rate-limiting.</p>

<p>Regardless of placing a rate-limiting scheme in the library or not, I'll want to write an application using the library, so suggested techniques will come in handy.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your suggestions!</p>

I have a table - stocks which contains information(products, barcodes etc.) about items stored in a fridge. I then have another table - shop which acts like a shop,containing loads of products and their barcodes.some of the products in the shop table are in the stock table at the moment, and there is a boolenan field called stock which tells us if that product is in the stock table or not, if its equal to 1, it is in the fridge, if it is equal to 0, it is not in the fridge. Two fields in the stocks table are amount and quantity. The amount is what is in the fridge at the moment, the quantity is what has to be in the fridge at all times. When something is taken out of the fridge, that product's amount amount drops by 1.  Each barcode in the stocks table has a matching one in the shop table. I need to make a query to the database from a python program which will order products from the shops table when the amount (whats in the fridge) is less than the quantity (whats meant to be in the fridge at all times). So you need to take the barcode of a row in the stocks table where the amount is less than the quantity and match that up to the barcode in the shops table.

<p>At compile time the identifier <code>pprint</code> is marked as local to the frame. Does the execution model have no distinction <em>where</em> within the frame the local identifier is bound?

I have realised that the reason I'm asking so many questions may not be because I'm so new to Python (but I know a good bit of PHP) and is probably not because Python has some inherent flaw.</p>

<p>Thus I will now say what the project is and what my current idea is and you can either tell me I'm doing it all wrong, that there's a few things I need to learn or that Python is simply not suited to dealing with this type of project and language XYZ would be better in this instance or even that there's some open source project I might want to get involved in.</p>

<p><strong>The project</strong><br>
I run a free turn based strategy game (think the campaign mode from the total war series but with even more complexity and depth) and am creating a combat simulator for it (again, think total war as an idea of how it'd work). I'm in no way deluded enough to think that I'll ever make anything as good as the Total war games alone but I do think that I can automate a process that I currently do by hand.</p>

<p><strong>What will it do</strong><br>
It will have to take into account a large range of variables for the units, equipment, training, weather, terrain and so on and so forth. I'm aware it's a big task and I plan to do it a piece at a time in my free time. I've zero budget but it's a hobby that I'm prepared to put time into (and have already).</p>

<p><strong>My current stumbling block</strong><br>
In PHP everything can access everything else, ""wrong"" though some might consider this it's really really handy for this. If I have an array of equipment for use by the units, I can get hold of that array from anywhere. With Python I have to remake that array each time I import the relevant data file and this seems quite a silly solution for a language that from my experience is well thought out. I've put in a system of logging function calls and class creation (because I know from a very basic version of this that I did in PHP once that it'll help a lot down the line) and the way that I've kept the data in one place is to pass each of my classes an instance to my logging list, smells like a hack to me but it's the only way I've gotten it to work.</p>

<p>Thus I conclude I'm missing something and would very much appreciate the insight of anybody willing to give it. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Code samples</strong></p>

<p>This creates a list of formations, so far there's only one value (besides the name) but I anticipate adding more on which is why they're a list of classes rather than just a standard list. This is found within data.py</p>

<pre><code>formations = []
formationsHash = []
def createFormations(logger):
	""""""This creates all the formations that will be used""""""

	# Standard close quarter formation, maximum number of people per square metre
	formationsHash.append('Tight')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Tight', tightness = 1))

	# Standard ranged combat formation, good people per square metre but not too cramped
	formationsHash.append('Loose')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Loose', tightness = 0.5))

	# Standard skirmishing formation, very good for moving around terrain and avoiding missile fire
	formationsHash.append('Skirmish')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Skirmish', tightness = 0.1))

	# Very unflexible but good for charges
	formationsHash.append('Arrowhead')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Arrowhead', tightness = 1))


def getFormation(searchFor):
	""""""Returns the fomation object with this name""""""
	indexValue = formationsHash.index(searchFor)
	return formations[indexValue]
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have a code sample of when I'd need to access it because I've not gotten as far as making it but I anticipate the code looking something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Python
tempFormation = data.getFormation(unit.formationType)
tempTerrain = data.getTerrain(unit.currentTerrain)
unit.attackDamage = unit.attackDamage * tempTerrain.tighnessBonus(tempFormation.tightness)
</code></pre>

<p>The unit contains an integer that links to the index/key of the relevant terrain, formation and whatnot in the master list. Temporary variables are used to make the 3rd line shorter but in the long run will possibly cause issues if I forget to get one and it's use a value from earlier which is then incorrect (that's where the logging comes in handy). </p>

<pre><code>PHP
$unit-&gt;attackDamage *= $terrain[$unit-&gt;currentTerrain]-&gt;tighnessBonus($unit-&gt;currentTerrain)
</code></pre>

<p>The unit class contains the index (probably a string) of the relevant terrain it's on and the formation it's in.</p>

<p>Maybe this will show some massive flaw in my understanding of Python (6 months vs the 3 years of PHP).</p>

<p>Besides formatting, the user must be able to use placeholders for a couple of variables that would get replaced at runtime. </p>

<p>The way this is currently working is very simple: the templates have the Pythonic %(var)s placeholders and I replace those with a dictionary before applying Markdown2 formatting.</p>

<p>Turns out that the end user of this system will be a tech-savvy user and I wouldn't like to make it obvious to everyone that it's written in Python. </p>

<p>It's not that I don't like Python... I actually think Python is the perfect tool for the job, I just don't want to expose that to the user (would like the same even if it were written in Java, Perl, Ruby or anything else).</p>

<p>So I'd like to ask for insights on what would be, in your opinion, the best way to expose placeholders for the users:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What do you think is the best placeholder format (thinks like ${var}, $(var) or #{var})?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be the best way to replace those placeholders?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I though of using a Regular Expression to change - for instance - ${var} into %(var)s and then applying the regular Python templating substitution, but I am not sure that's the best approach.</p>

<p>If you go that way, it would be very nice if you could indicate me what is a draft of that regular expression as well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: An user pointed out using full-blown templating systems, but I think that may not be worth it, since all I need is placeholders substitution: I won't have loops or anything like that.</p>

<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: I have chosen not to use any template engines at this time. I chose to go with the simpler string.Template approach (as pointed out on a comment by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/49032/hyperboreean"">hyperboreean</a>). Truth is that I don't like to pick a solution because sometime in the future there may be a need. I will keep all those suggestions on my sleeve, and if on the lifespan of the application there is a clear need for one or more features offered by them, I'll revisit the idea. Right now, I really think it's an overkill. Having full blown templates that <strong>the end user</strong> can edit as he wants is, at least on my point of view, more trouble than benefit. Nevertheless, it feels much nicer being aware of the reasons I did not went down that path, than just not researching anything and choosing it. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for all the input.</p>

1950,407464,,2009-01-02T17:22:29Z,1,How to synchronize the same object on client and server side in client-server application? Is small messages framework good for this job?,"<p>I'm making a game engine in c++ and python. I'm using OGRE for 3D rendering, OpenAL for sound, ODE for physics, OIS for input, HawkNL for networking and boost.python for embedded python interpreter. Every subsystem (library) is wrapped by a class - manager and every manager is singleton. Now, I have a class - Object - this could be every visible object in game world. This is some kind of mix, object has graphics representation (entity) and representation in physics simulator (solid). These two are most important here. Class Object is just pure abstract base class - interface. I've decided to implement Object on client side as ObjectClientSide - this implementation has the entity, and on server side as ObjectServerSide - this implementation has the solid. Physics simulator runs only on server, and rendering is done only on client of course. The object can exist only when both implementations are working together. Every object has unique id and both instances of the same object on client and server side have the same id.</p>

<p>So, after this short background, my first question is: is this design good? How can I make it better? And the main question: how should I synchronize these objects?</p>

<p>Next, both implementations have the same interface, but part of it is implemented on server side and part on client side. So, for example, if player wants to move forward his character he should send a request to object on server. The server then makes changes to simulation and sends updated position to client. For that reason, I've created small messages framework. There is a Message class, Router, Rule and rules inherited from Rule. When message arrives, Router checks it against the rules and sends it to destination. So, when I call myObjectInstanceOnClientSide->setPosition(x,y,z) this object creates Message, its content is function and parameters and destination is object with the same id on server. When object with the same id on server side gets this message it calls this function with given arguments. So, when a function can't be implemented on one side it creates a message and sends it to object on the other side. I think this can be very useful in scripts. Scripts can be very clean, if script needs for example turn on animation on clients, I only need to call this function on server's local object - the rest is in background.</p>

<p>So, is this ok? Am I wrong about this? It this common solution?</p>

<p>When I right click a file, choose Send To, and select Aquate (my python), it opens a command prompt for a split second and then closes it. Nothing gets uploaded.</p>

<p>I knew there was probably an error going on so I typed the code into CL python, line by line.
When I ran the <code>u=urllib2.urlopen(req)</code> line, I didn't get an error;

<p>What's up with this script?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Forgot to mention -- when I ran the script without the request data (the file) it ran like a charm. Is it a problem with urllib2_file?</p>

<p>I need to be able to catch unhandled exceptions during my mainloop so that I can further handle them and display them in error dialogs, not pass silently, and not terminate the app.</p>

<p>The sys.excepthook solution is too low level and doesn't play nice with the wxPython mainloop thread.  While the link to the other answer does the same try/except wrapping around the mainloop which doesn't work due, once again, to wxPython spawning a different thread for the app/ui.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of mailboxes in Maildir format (a backup from the mail server on my old web host), and I need to extract the emails from these. 
So far, the simplest way I've found has been to convert them to the mbox format, which Thunderbird supports, and it seems Python has a few classes for reading/writing both formats. Seems perfect.</p>

<p>The Python docs even have this little code snippet doing exactly what I need:</p>

<pre><code>src = mailbox.Maildir('maildir', factory=None)
dest = mailbox.mbox('/tmp/mbox')

for msg in src:   #1
    dest.add(msg) #2
</code></pre>

<p><em>Except</em> it doesn't work. And here's where my complete lack of knowledge about Python sets in.
On a few messages, I get a UnicodeDecodeError during the iteration (that is, when it's trying to read <code>msg</code> from <code>src</code>, on line <code>#1</code>). On others, I get a UnicodeEncodeError when trying to add <code>msg</code> to <code>dest</code> (line <code>#2</code>).</p>

<p>Clearly it makes some wrong assumptions about the encoding used. But I have no clue how to specify an encoding on the mailbox (For that matter, I don't know what the encoding should be either, but I can probably figure that out once I find a way to actually specify an encoding). </p>

<p>I get stack traces similar to the following:</p>

<p>The Django model class provides a simple method <em>get</em> which allows me to search for <em>one and only one</em> object from the database, if it finds more or less it raises an exception. If can find zero or more with an alternative <em>filter</em> method, which returns a list:</p>

<pre><code>objects = ModelClass.objects.filter(search=value)
if len(objects) == 1:
    object = objects[0]

<p><strong>Am I overly averse to exceptions?</strong> To me the exception seems a little wasteful, at a guess, a quarter-to-a-half of the time will be 'exceptional'. I'd much prefer a function that returns <em>None</em> on failure. Would I be better to use Django's <em>filter</em> method and process the list myself?</p>

The only problem is that urlfetch returns a single string of the entire HTML document, removing all newlines and extra spaces.</p>

Okay, I tried fetching a different URL and apparently urlfetch does not strip the newlines, it was the original webpage I was trying to parse that served the HTML file that way...

return type('ContactForm', [forms.BaseForm], { 'base_fields': fields })
</code></pre>

<p>So here is what I came up with...</p>

<h1>The Answer I used:</h1>

<pre><code>
from tagging.forms import TagField
from django import forms

def make_tagPhotos_form(photoIdList):
    ""Expects a LIST of photo objects (ie. photo_sharing.models.photo)""

    fields = {}

    for id in photoIdList:
    	id = str(id)

    	fields[id+'_name'] = forms.CharField()
    	fields[id+'_tags'] = TagField()
    	fields[id+'_description'] = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    return type('tagPhotos', (forms.BaseForm,), { 'base_fields': fields })

</code></pre>

<p>note tagging is not part of django, but it is free and very useful. check it out: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/"">django-tagging</a></p>

1983,411902,,2009-01-04T23:28:35Z,8,Django file upload failing occasionally,"<p>I am trying to port my first Django 1.0.2 application to run on OSX/Leopard with Apache + mod_python 3.3.1 + python 2.6.1 (all running in 64-bit mode) and I am experiencing an occasional error when uploading a file that was not present when testing with the Django development server. </p>

<p>The code for the upload is similar to what described in the Django documentation:</p>

<pre><code>class UploadFileForm(forms.Form):
    file  = forms.FileField()
    description = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    notifygroup = forms.BooleanField(label='Notify Group?', required=False)

    print date, meetingid
    if request.method == 'POST':
        print 'before reloading the form...'
        form = UploadFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
    print 'after reloading the form'
        if form.is_valid():
            try: 
                handle_uploaded_file(request.FILES['file'], request.REQUEST['date'], request.REQUEST['description'], form.cleaned_data['notifygroup'], meetingid )
            except:

    return render_to_response('upload.html', {'form': form, 'date':date, 'meetingid':meetingid})

Therefore I have to handle a lot of Parameters. Now the Idea is that I have two classes, one for a SingleParameter and a Collection of parameters. I use property() to access the parameter value easy and to make the code more readable. This works perfect for a sinlge parameter but I don't know how to implement it for the collection as I want to name the property in Collection after the SingleParameter. Here an example:</p>

<pre><code>class SingleParameter(object):

    self.name = name
    self.default_value = default_value
    self.unit = unit
    self.set(default_value)
  def get(self):
    return self._v
  def set(self, value):
    self._v = value
  v = property(fget=get, fset=set, doc='value of parameter')

par1 = SingleParameter(name='par1', default_value=10, unit='mV')
par2 = SingleParameter(name='par2', default_value=20, unit='mA')

# par1 and par2 I can access perfectly via 'p1.v = ...'
# or get its value with 'p1.v'

class Collection(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.dict = {}
  def __getitem__(self, name):
    return self.dict[name] # get the whole object
    # to get the value instead:
    # return self.dict[name].v
  def add(self, parameter):
    self.dict[parameter.name] = parameter
    # now comes the part that I don't know how to implement with property():
    # It shoule be something like
    # self.__dict__[parameter.name] = property(...) ?

col = Collection()
col.add(par1)
col.add(par2)
col['par1'] # gives the whole object

# Now here is what I would like to get:
# col.par1 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v
# col.par1 = 5 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v = 5

<p>My question is, does cherrypy have a built in handler to handle multipart/mixed and chunked encoding for POST?  Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p>

<p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>...to clarify</p>

<p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p>

<p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p>

<p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p>

<p>In that example, I get:</p>

<pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] 
kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p>

<p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p>

<pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
content-language:en-US
content-length:565719
mime-version:1.0
content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'
host:192.168.1.1:8180
transfer-encoding:chunked



--newdivider
Content-type: text/xml

&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;Stuff&gt;....
etc...etc...

--newdivider
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpg
Content-transfer-encoding: binary

&lt;binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>

I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>"

<p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p>

<p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p>

<p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p>

I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.</p>

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

From these methods I can return wx.DragNone, wx.DragCopy, etc. What baffles me is that from within these methods I am not allowed to call GetData, which means I am not allowed to examine the data that the user is dragging.

I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>

<p>I'm running these scripts on a system where <code>env python</code> yields a Python 2.2 environment. My scripts quickly fail because I have a manual check for a compatible Python version:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):
    raise ImportError(""Cannot run with Python version &lt; 2.4"")
</code></pre>

<p>I don't want to have to change the shebang line on every executable file, if it's possible; however, I don't have administrative access to the machine to change the result of <code>env python</code> and I don't want to force a particular version, as in:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.4
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to avoid this because system may have a newer version than Python 2.4, or may have Python 2.5 but no Python 2.4.</p>

<p>What's the elegant solution?</p>

<p>[Edit:] I wasn't specific enough in posing the question -- I'd like to let users execute the scripts without manual configuration (e.g. path alteration or symlinking in <code>~/bin</code> and ensuring your PATH has <code>~/bin</code> before the Python 2.2 path). Maybe some distribution utility is required to prevent the manual tweaks?</p>

136,43368,4462.0,2008-09-04T08:53:58Z,11,A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?,"<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is ""zoomed in"" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p>

<p>This is all in Firefox 3.  I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p>

<p>Has anyone else encountered any bizarre behavior anything like this before?  I am at a loss.</p>

However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Level contains:

<ul>
<li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li>
<li>all .html templates for main level pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subdirectories:

<ul>
<li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at ""index.html""<br/>
<a href=""http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at ""games/view-series.html""</p>

<p>It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

<p>I would like to modify this <a href=""http://wordaligned.org/articles/a-subversion-pre-commit-hook"" rel=""nofollow"">script</a> to validate that the check-in file does not have a Carriage Return in the EOL formatting. The EOL format is CR LF in Windows and LF in Unix. When a User checks-in code with the Windows format. It does not compile in Unix anymore. I know this can be done on the client side but I need to have this validation done on the server side. To achieve this, I need to do the following:</p>

<p>1) Make sure the file I check is not a binary, I dont know how to do this with svnlook, should I check the mime:type of the file? The <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.reposadmin.create.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Red Book</a> does not indicate this clearly or I must have not seen it.</p>

<p>2) I would like to run the <a href=""http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl1_dos2uni.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">dos2unix</a> command to validate that the file has the correct EOL format. I would compare the output of the dos2unix command against the original file. If there is a diff between both, I give an error message to the client and cancel the check-in.</p>

<p>I would like your comments/feedback on this approach.</p>

PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).

<p>I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).

177,51502,5342.0,2008-09-09T10:05:36Z,2,Improving Python readability?,"<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>

<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>

<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(id), avg(a), avg(b), avg(c), avg(d) FROM tuples;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?</p>

<p>The schema (the table holds responses to a survey):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

199,58711,745.0,2008-09-12T11:18:04Z,11,"How would you design a very ""Pythonic"" UI framework?","<p>I have been playing with the Ruby library ""shoes"". Basically you can write a GUI application in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.</p>

<p>The scope of various stuff (say, the <code>la</code> label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..</p>

<pre><code>siteroot/
	models/
	controllers/
		controller1/
		controller2/
		...
	templates/
		template1/
		template2/
		...
</code></pre>

<p>..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate (Django-style) templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps I've seen resolve template paths like this:</p>

<pre><code>path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'myPage.html')
</code></pre>

<p>...the __ file __ property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllers/controller1/, then the 'myPage.html' would resolve to that same directory -- controllers/controller1/myPage.html -- and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.</p>

<p>The solution I've hacked together feels... hacky:</p>

<pre><code>base_paths = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))
template_dir = os.path.join(base_paths[0], ""templates"")
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other (non-GAE specific) solutions I've seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight (such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly).  Django seems to have an answer for this, but I'd rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.</p>

<p>I'm assuming anything hard-coded would be non-starter, since the apps live on Google's infinite server farm.  So what's a better way?</p>

<p>Question: Is it possible to store these regular expressions in a cache on disk in a pre-compiled manner to avoid having to execute the regex compilations on each import?</p>

<p>Pickling the object simply does the following, causing compilation to happen anyway:</p>

How, then, can one explain this</p>

...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):

>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>So much for encapsulation, eh?</p>

<p>In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?</p>

But is_valid() always fails on unbound forms.</p>

<p>It seems like Django's forms were designed with the use case of editing data such that an unbound form isn't really useful for anything other than displaying HTML.</p>

<p>For example, if I have:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()

    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

<p>the first call to do_query triggers exceptions on form.cleaned_data, which is not a valid field because is_valid() has not been called. It seems like I have to do something like:</p>

    form = MyForm()

    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

<p>Ruby has similar issues and although I do like Ruby <strong>much</strong> better than I like Python, I get the impression that Rails is roughly in the same boat at Django when it comes to managing/supporting the app. </p>

<p>Has anyone here tried both Django and Grails (or other web frameworks) for non-trivial projects? How did they compare?</p>

  <p>In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation. This allows splitting tables with nicer effects around the split.</p>

276,79454,10840.0,2008-09-17T02:52:58Z,5,Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?,"<p>Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).</p>

<p>I chose a mocking library called <a href=""http://labix.org/mocker"" rel=""nofollow"">mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():
    def test(config):
        ac = AppController()
        m = Mocker()
        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)
        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))
        with m:
            result = ac.current_window_controller()
            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)
    yield test, []
    yield test, [0]
    yield test, [1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:</p>

<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):
    try:
        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting
        # with the controller of the top-most window
        # assumption: the top-most window is the ""current"" one
        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return wc
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>

<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>

<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>

We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>

<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>
</ol>

<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.</p>

<p>Now, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>

<p>In Haskell I would use Parsec, a library of parsing functions (known as combinators).  Is there a Python implementation of Parsec?  Or perhaps some other production quality library full of parsing functionality so I can build a context sensitive parser in Python?</p>

<p>EDIT: All my attempts at context free parsing have failed.  For this reason, I don't expect ANTLR to be useful here.</p>

This code:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int my_type;
my_type x;
</code></pre>

<p>Is correct C code, because my_type is defined as a type previously to
being used as such. I handle it by filling a type symbol table in the
parser that gets used by the lexer to differentiate between types and
simple identifiers.</p>

<p>However, while the type declaration rule ends with SEMI (the ';' token), PLY shifts the token <code>my_type</code> from the second line before deciding it's done with the first one. Because of this, I have no chance to pass the update in the type symbol table to the lexer and it
sees my_type as an identifier and not a type.</p>

<p>Any ideas for a fix ?</p>

<p>The full code is at: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/source/browse/trunk/src/c_parser.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/source/browse/trunk/src/c_parser.py</a>

<li>Wait, and repeat steps 2-5.</li>

<p>The problem I can see there is if the tests are in a different file. The simple solution would be to run all the tests after each save.. but with slower tests, this might take longer than the time between saves, and/or could use a lot of CPU power etc..</p>

However, I can't remember how to pass variables between different classes.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I have:</p>

<pre><code>class BasicInfoPage(wx.wizard.WizardPageSimple):            
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
         wiz.WizardPageSimple.__init__(self, parent)
         self.next = self.prev = None
         self.sizer = makePageTitle(self, title)

                    &lt;---snip---&gt;

         self.intelligence = self.genAttribs()

class MOS(wx.wizard.WizardPageSimple):
     def __init__(self, parent, title):
         wiz.WizardPageSimple.__init__(self, parent)
         self.next = self.prev = None
         self.sizer = makePageTitle(self, title)
      def eligibleMOS(self, event):
          if self.intelligence &gt;= 12: 
               self.MOS_list.append(""Analyst"")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I can't figure out how to use the ""intelligence"" variable from the BasicInfoPage class to the MOS class. I've tried several different things from around the Internet but nothing seems to work. What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I realized after I posted this that I didn't explain it that well. I'm trying to create a computer version of the Twilight 2000 RPG from the 1980s.</p>

<p>I'm using wxPython to create a wizard; the parent class of my classes is the Wizard from wxPython. That wizard will walk a user through the creation of a character, so the Basic Information page (class BasicInfoPage) lets the user give the character's name and ""roll"" for the character's attributes. That's where the ""self.intelligence"" comes from.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the attributes created her for a page further on in the wizard, where the user selects the speciality of the character. The specialities that are available depend on the attributes the character has, e.g. if the intelligence is high enough, the character can be an Intel Anaylst.</p>

<p>It's been several years since I've programmed, especially with OOP ideas. That's why I'm confused on how to create what's essentially a global variable with classes and methods. </p>

error types that I find extremely useful--:<code>E1101: *%s %r has no %r
member*</code>--constantly reports errors when using common django fields,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>E1101:125:get_user_tags: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member

<pre><code>def get_user_tags(username):

   Returns a query set.
   """"""
   return Tag.objects.filter(  ## This line triggers the error.

# Here is the Tag class, models.Model is provided by Django:
class Tag(models.Model):
   """"""

   """"""

<p>How can I tune Pylint to properly take fields such as objects into account?  (I've also looked into the Django source, and I have been unable to find the implementation of <code>objects</code>, so I suspect it is not ""just"" a class field.  On the other hand, I'm fairly new to python, so I may very well have overlooked something.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.  If there is another way, without augmenting the pylint source, please point me to specifics :)</p>

the_str = 'p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t   \n     \n\tp3'

So, even though my application is working, I'm curious whether there is a better way to accomplish my goals.</p>

<p>Specifics: How does one typically implement the request-transform-render database workflow in Python?

<p>var result = 
    from n in db.Numbers
        where n.Number &lt; 5
        select n.Number;</p>

<p>This will run very efficiently in C#, because it generates an SQL query something like ""select Number from Numbers where Number &lt; 5"".  What it <em>doesn't</em> do is select <em>all</em> the numbers from the database, and then filter them in C#, as it might appear to do at first.</p>

<p>Python supports a similar syntax:</p>

<p>result = [n.Number for n in Numbers if n.Number &lt; 5]</p>

429,118540,,2008-09-23T01:04:10Z,0,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>

<pre><code>find ~/podcasts/current -mindepth 2 -mtime '+`a`+' -exec mv {} ~/podcasts/old \;
</code></pre>

<p>I am familiar with the os.name and getpass.getuser for the most general cross-platform elements.  I also have this function to generate a list of the full names of all the files in the equivalent of ~/podcasts/current:</p>

<pre><code>def AllFiles(filepath, depth=1, flist=[]):

<p>The issue I'm having is getting the script to work correctly on windows with a command that contains ampersands in it's path. I've attempted quoting the command, escaping the ampersand with ^ and neither works. I'm now out of ideas. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>To clarify from current responses:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am using the subprocess module</li>
<li>I am passing the command line + arguments in as a list</li>
<li>The issue is with the path to the command itself, not any of the arguments</li>
<li>I've tried quoting the command. It causes a <code>[Error 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect</code> error</li>
<li>I'm using no shell argument (so <code>shell=false</code>) </li>
<li>In case it matters, I'm grabbing a pipe to stderr for processing it, but ignoring stdout and stdin</li>
<li>It is only for use on Windows currently, and works as expected in all other cases that I've tested so far.</li>
<li>The command that is failing is:  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>p = subprocess.Popen(prog, stderr = subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=-1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when the first element of the list 'prog' contains any ampersands. Quoting this first string does not work.</p>

I really would like to know how to generate a list of N unique random numbers using a functional language such as Ruby without having to be extremely imperative in style.</p>

<p>Since I didn't see anything I really liked, I've written the solution I was looking for in LINQ:   </p>

<pre><code>
       static void Main(string[] args)
    	{
    		var temp = from q in GetRandomNumbers(100).Distinct().Take(5) select q;
    	}

    	private static IEnumerable GetRandomNumbers(int max)
    	{
    		Random r = new Random();
    		while (true)
    		{
    			yield return r.Next(max);
    		}
    	}
</code></pre>

<p>Can you translate my LINQ to Ruby? Python? Any other functional programming language?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please try not to use too many loops and conditionals - otherwise the solution is trivial. Also, I'd rather see a solution where you don't have to generate an array much bigger than N so you can then just remove the duplicates and trim it down to N.</p>

<p>I know I'm being picky, but I'd really like to see some elegant solutions to this problem.
Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />
Why all the downvotes? </p>

<p>Originally my code sample had the Distinct() after the Take() which, as many pointed out, could leave me with an empty list. I've changed the order in which those methods are called to reflect what I meant in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Apology:</strong><br />
I've been told this post came across as rather snobbish. I wasn't trying to imply that LINQ is better than Ruby/Python; or that my solution is much better than everyone else's. My intent is just to learn how to do this (with certain constraints) in Ruby. I'm sorry if I came across as a jerk.</p>

<p>I have Transitions in an automata. Transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. Some Transitions have a label, which encodes a certain Action that must be performed upon traversal. No label means no action. Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.</p>

<p>I need the following operations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>check if the transition has a label</li>
<li>get this label</li>
<li>add a label to a transition</li>
<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>
<li>get this condition</li>
<li>check for equality</li>

<p>Judging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition. However, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(""foo"", Conditional(""bar"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) and Conditional(""bar"", Labeled(""foo"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:</p>

<pre><code>class Transition(object):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
    def get_label(self):
        return None
    def has_label(self):
        return False
    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):
        return decorations
    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):
        try:
            return (self.start == other.start
                    and self.end == other.end
                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)

class Labeled(object):
    def __init__(self, label, base):
        self.base = base
        self.label = label
    def has_label(self):
        return True
    def get_label(self):
        return self.label
    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):
        assert 'label' not in decorations
        decorations['label'] = self.label
        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)
    def __getattr__(self, attribute):
        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a clean approach? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I am mostly confused, because I can solve this - with longer class names - using cooperative multiple inheritance:</p>

<pre><code>class Transition(object):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # init is pythons MI-madness ;-)
        super(Transition, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.start = kwargs['start']
        self.end = kwargs['end']
    def get_label(self):
        return None
    def get_condition(self):
        return None
    def __eq__(self, other):
        try:
            return self.start == other.start and self.end == other.end
        except AttributeError:
            return False

class LabeledTransition(Transition):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(LabeledTransition).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.label = kwargs['label']
    def get_label(self):
        return self.label
    def __eq__(self):
        super_result = super(LabeledTransition, self).__eq__(other)
        try:
            return super_result and self.label == other.label
        except AttributeError:
            return False

class ConditionalTransition(Transition):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(ConditionalTransition, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.condition = kwargs['condition']

    def get_condition(self):
        return self.condition

    def __eq__(self, other):
        super_result = super(ConditionalTransition, self).__eq__(other)
        try:
            return super_result and self.condition = other.condition
        except AttributeError:
            return False

# ConditionalTransition about the same, with get_condition
class LabeledConditionalTransition(LabeledTransition, ConditionalTransition):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>the class LabledConditionalTransition behaves exactly as expected - and having no code in there is appealing and I do not thing MI is confusing at this size.</p>

<p>Of course, the third option would be to just hammer everything into a single transition class with a bunch of in has_label/has_transition.</p>

<p>So... I am confused. Am I missing something? Which implementation looks better? How do you handle similar cases, that is, objects which look like a Decorator could handle them, but then, such a non-local method comes around?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em>:
Added the ConditionalTransition-class. Basically, this kinda behaves like the decorator, minus the order created by the order of creating the decorators, the transition checks for start and end being correct, the LabeledTransition-class checks for label being correct and ConditionalTransition checks for condition being correct.</p>

<p><code>[(id\__1_, description, id\_type), (id\__2_, description, id\_type), ... , (id\__n_, description, id\_type))</code></p>

<p>The data are loaded from files that belong to the same group. In each group there could be multiples of the same id, each coming from different files. I don't care about the duplicates, so I thought that a nice way to store all of this would be to throw it into a Set type. But there's a problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes for the same id the descriptions can vary slightly, as follows:</p>

<p>IPI00110753</p>

<ul>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1A chain</li>
<li>Tubulin alpha-1 chain</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin 1</li>
<li>Alpha-tubulin isotype M-alpha-1</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that this example is taken from the <a href=""http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68369"" rel=""nofollow"">uniprot protein database</a>.) </p>

<p>I don't care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.</p>

<p>I am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don't really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID's). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID's go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.</p>

<p>I have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven't thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? </p>

<p>Thank you for reading my question, <br>
Tim</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>based on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. </p>

<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?</p>

<p>*The information is a list of Swiss-Prot protein identifiers that I get by querying uniprot.</p>

    DevEnvDir          OutDir           SafeInputName      TargetFramework
    FrameworkDir       ParentName       SafeParentName     TargetName

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

The servers will communicate with each other in a cluster. Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table. The exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning, and it's important that it's possible for the person running the cluster (eg, myself) to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server.</p>

<p>Simply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.</p>

<p>What I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>

<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression. You can also concatenate multiple independent result sets together.</p>

<p>I realise this question sounds a lot like I'm asking for SQL. However, I don't want to require that the datastore backing this data be a relational database, and I don't want the overhead of trying to reimplement SQL myself. I'm also dealing with only a single table with a known schema. Finally, no joins will be required. Something much simpler would be far preferable.</p>

534,140295,5442.0,2008-09-26T15:38:00Z,2,Using locale.setlocale in embedded Python without breaking file parsing in C thread,"<p>We're using a third-party middleware product that allows us to write code in an embedded Python interpreter, and which exposes an API that we can call into. Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.</p>

<p>We've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>

<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
currentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
displayNumbersToTheUser()
locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.</p>

<p>Any information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.</p>

<li>Jump-to a class definition. I'm guessing CTAGS will do this, so how do you all manage automatically updating your tags files?</li>
<li>Project type management for managing buffers: ideally the ability to grep for a filename in a directory structure to open it. Bonus for showing an index of class definitions while a buffer is open.</li>
<li>Bzr integration. Not super important, since most of it I can just drop to the shell to do.</li>

One problem that I'm running into is that significant figures don't always seem to come out properly.  For example this handles significant figures properly:</p>

<pre><code>from decimal import Decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal('1.0') + Decimal('2.0')
Decimal(""3.0"")

<p>But this doesn't:</p>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I right that this isn't the expected amount of significant digits, or do I need to brush up on significant digit math?</li>
<li>Is there any way to do this without having to set the decimal precision manually?  Granted, I'm sure I can use numpy to do this, but I just want to know if there's a way to do this with the decimal module out of curiosity.</li>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61451/does-django-have-html-helpers"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61451/does-django-have-html-helpers</a></p>

<p>My problem is this: In Django, I am constantly reproducing the basic formatting for low-level database objects. Here's an example:</p>

<p>I have two classes, Person and Address. There are multiple Addresses for each Person, setup likeso (in their respective <strong>models.py</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>class Person(models.Model):
  ...

class Address(models.Model):
  contact = models.ForeignKey(Person)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever I look at a Person, I want to see all their Addresses. So suppose <strong>Persons/views.py</strong> has something likeso:</p>

<pre><code>def detail(request, person_id):
   person = get_object_or_404( Person, pk=person_id )
   return render_to_response('persons/details.html',
      { 'title' : unicode(person), 'addresses': person.address_set.all() } )
</code></pre>

<p>And, I have a template, <strong>persons/details.html</strong>, with code, for example, like-so:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}

{% for address in addresses %}
&lt;b&gt;{{ address.name }}&lt;/b&gt;
  {{ address.type }} &lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_1 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_2 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.city }} {{ address.stateprov }} {{ address.postalcode }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.country }}
  &lt;hr&gt;
{{ endfor }}
</code></pre>

<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it's in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don't want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>

<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
{% for address in addresses %} 
  {% address.as_html4 %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
{% for address in addresses %}
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, then: Where is the best place to put the formatting? The logic?</p>

<p>Django seem to have the following (plausible) options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the formatting in models.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in views.py</p></li>
<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in some other sub-class of Person or Address (i.e.  addresses/html4.py)</p></li>
<li><p>Create custom tags</p></li>
</ol>

def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""Computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the function name and documentation are correct:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function funny_function in module __main__:

funny_function(*args, **kwargs)
    Computes x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>But there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information ""*args, **kwargs"" is next to useless.</p>

<p>What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:</p>

<p>1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>

<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):
    def g(x, y, z=3):
        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>

<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of ""*kwargs, **kwargs"" when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?</p>

<p>Any other approaches?</p>

That part works fine - I can run the Python web server application from the command line and I can have clients connect to it and get data back. At the moment, to run the web server I have to be logged in to our server as the administrator user and I have to manually start the web server. I want to have the web server automatically start on system start as a service and run in the background.</p>

<p>Using code from <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576451/"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveState</a>'s site and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how"">StackOverflow</a>, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:</p>

<pre><code>server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a ""stop"" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:</p>

<pre><code>def SvcStop(self):
    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
    exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to get called when I do ""python myservice stop"" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to ""python myservice start"" gives me an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error starting service: An instance of
  the service is already running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and subsequent calls to stop gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error stopping service: The service
  cannot accept control messages at this
  time. (1061)</p>

<p>I think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.</p>

<p>My first alternative, While only iterating through the list once and avoiding the list expansion (and keeping the <a href=""http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/splitLoop.html"">split loop</a> refactoring in mind), looks rather bloated:</p>

<p>(alt 1)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

twos = 0
threes = 0

for v in r:
  if v % 2 == 0:
    twos+=1
  if v % 3 == 0:
    threes+=1

print twos
print threes
</code></pre>

<p>This looks rather nice, but has the drawback of expanding the expression to a list:</p>

<p>(alt 2)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print len([1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0])
print len([1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0])
</code></pre>

<p>What I would really like is something like a function like this:</p>

<p>(alt 3)</p>

<pre><code>def count(iterable):
  n = 0
  for i in iterable:
    n += 1
  return n

r = xrange(1, 10)

print count(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print count(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>But this looks a lot like something that could be done without a function. The final variant is this:</p>

<p>(alt 4)</p>

<pre><code>r = xrange(1, 10)

print sum(1 for v in r if v % 2 == 0)
print sum(1 for v in r if v % 3 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>and while the smallest (and in my book probably the most elegant) it doesn't feel like it expresses the intent very well.</p>

<p>So, my question to you is:</p>

<p>Which alternative do you like best to gather these types of stats? Feel free to supply your own alternative if you have something better.</p>

<p>To clear up some confusion below:</p>

<ul>
<li>In reality my filter predicates are more complex than just this simple test.</li>
<li>The objects I iterate over are larger and more complex than just numbers</li>
<li>My filter functions are more different and hard to parameterize into one predicate</li>

When I say accurately I mean each timestamp should be accurate relative to each other (no need to sync to an atomic clock or anything like that).</p>

<p>I've been using datetime.now() as a first stab, but this isn't perfect:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,1000):
...     datetime.datetime.now()

datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 562000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 578000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>The changes between clocks for the first second of samples looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>uSecs    difference
562000  
578000  16000
609000  31000
625000  16000
640000  15000
656000  16000
687000  31000
703000  16000
718000  15000
750000  32000
765000  15000
781000  16000
796000  15000
828000  32000
843000  15000
859000  16000
890000  31000
906000  16000
921000  15000
937000  16000
968000  31000
984000  16000
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the timer data is only updated every ~15-32ms on my machine. The problem comes when we come to analyse the data because sorting by something other than the timestamp and then sorting by timestamp again can leave the data in the wrong order (chronologically). It would be nice to have the time stamps accurate to the point that any call to the time stamp generator gives a unique timestamp.</p>

<p>I had been considering some methods involving using a time.clock() call added to a starting datetime, but would appreciate a solution that would work accurately across threads on the same machine. Any suggestions would be very gratefully received.</p>

<p>In Python, it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/773/how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby"">how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Car(models.Model):
    mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Mods(models.Model):
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>How does one get a list of Cars, grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p>

<p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p>

<pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ 
  { mods: { 'a' }, cars: { 'W1', 'W2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b' }, cars: { 'X1', 'X2', 'X3' }, },
  { mods: { 'b' }, cars: { 'Y1', 'Y2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b', 'c' }, cars: { 'Z1' } },
]

<p>I've been thinking of something like:</p>

<pre><code>def cars_by_common_mods():
  cars = Cars.objects.all()

  mod_list = []      

  for car in cars:
    mod_list.append( { 'car': car, 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } 

  ret = []

  for key, mods_group in groupby(list(mods), lambda x: set(x.mods)):
    ret.append(mods_group)

  return ret
</code></pre>

<p>However, that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say, I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating.</p>

The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.</p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>

<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>

<p>$ git clone [repository url]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...</p>

<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>

<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>

So I have 3 expressions and would like to tokenize the line and extract tokens of text matching every expression.</p>

an elegant way to do this by executing ""actions"" based on expressions. One can control the way

<p>This all works just fine for small workloads.  However, I recently used <code>urllib2</code> to write a stress-testing script that would simulate a workload of 100 clients.

<p>My guess is that I need to some how get a handle to the window and then send it an event that looks like the ""ctrl+f"" keystroke. </p>

<p>If it makes any difference, it looks like flashplayer is a gtk application and I have python with pygtk installed.</p>

<p>My question is this: How can I package up and sell a Django app, while protecting its code from pirating or theft? Distributing a bunch of .py files doesn't sound like a good idea as the people I sell it to too could just make copies of them and pass them on.</p>

<p>Say you have a system of nodes communicating with each other on a network via asynchronous messages. The nodes do not maintain session information about other nodes (this is a design restriction).</p>

<p>Say you want to make sure only your nodes can read the messages being sent. I believe encryption is the sollution to that.</p>

<p>Since the nodes are not maintaining a session and communication must work in a stateless, connectionless fashion, I am guessing that asymmetric encryption is ruled out.</p>

<p>So here is what I would like to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>messages are sent as UDP datagrams</li>
<li>each message contains a timestamp to make messages differ (counter replay attacks)</li>
<li>each message is encrypted with a shared secret symmetric key and sent over the network</li>
<li>other end can decrypt with shared secret symmetric key</li>
</ul>

<p>Keys can obviously be compromised by compromising any single node. At the same time, in this scenario, access to any single compromised node reveals all interesting information anyway, so the key is not the weakest link.</p>

<p>What cypher should I use for this encryption? What key length?</p>

<p>I would prefer to use something supported by <a href=""http://www.freenet.org.nz/ezPyCrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">ezPyCrypto</a>.</p>

<pre><code>b = wx.Button(self, 10, ""Default Button"", (20, 20))
        self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnClick, b)
def OnClick(self, event):
        self.log.write(""Click! (%d)\n"" % event.GetId())

Here are my assumptions - I think they're similar for alot of people right now:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is now October 2008.  I want to start writing an application for January 2009.  I am willing to use beta code and such but by January, I'd like a site that doesn't have 'strange' problems.  With that said, if a language is simply 10% slower than another, I don't care about those things as long as the issue is linear.  My main concern is developer productivity.</li>
<li>I'll be using Linux, Apache, MySQL for the application.</li>
<li>I want the power to do things like run scp and ftp client functions with stable libraries (I only picked those two because they're not web-related but at the same time represent pretty common network protocols that any larger app might use).  Technologies like OpenID and Oauth will be used as well.</li>
<li>Experienced web developers are readily available (i.e. I don't have to find people from financial companies and such).</li>
<li>Whatever the choice is is common and will be around for a while.</li>
<li>Here's a kicker.  I'd like to be able to use advanced presentation layer tools/languages similar to HAML, SASS.  I definitively want to use JQuery.</li>
<li>I will be creating a Facebook app and at some point doing things like dealing with SMS messages, iPhone apps, etc...</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, the choices for language are PHP (Cake,Symfony,Zend), Python (Django), Ruby (Merb).  I'm really between Django and Merb at this point mostly because everybody else seems to be going that way.  </p>

<p>Please don't put any technologies in here that aren't made for mainstream.  I know Merb is untested mostly, but their stated goal is a solid platform and it has alot of momentum behind it so I'm confident that it's workable.  Please don't answer with how great Perl is or .Net.</p>

<p>For Future References - these choices were already made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debian (Lenny) - For converting CPU cycles into something useful. Trac</li>
<li>0.11 - For Project Management Gliffy - For wireframes and such </li>
<li>Google Docs/Apps - For documentation, hosted email, etc... </li>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Where both app1 and app2 are independent applications with their own code and tests, but are also including and using both lib1 and lib2. And lib1/test, lib1/code, lib2/test, lib2code, app1, app2 are separate eggs. Does this sound right?</p>

<p>However, I now get confused. I assume that when I develop app1, I want buildout to pull copies of lib1, lib2 and app1 into a separate working directory rather than put copies of these libraries under app1 directly. But how does this work with my SVN source-control? If the working directory is dynamically constructed with buildout, it can't be a live SVN directory from which I can check the changes back into the repository?</p>

<p>Have I misunderstood how buildout is meant to be used? Would I be better going for a completely different approach? How do you mix source-control with module-reuse between projects?</p>

<p>Update : thanks to the two people who've currently answered this question. I'm experimenting more with this.</p>

<p>What's the closest, simplest Ruby idiom to replicate this behavior?  (No monkeypatching the String class, please.)</p>

<p>The <code>DBA_WAITERS</code> table has 182 entries with lock type ""DML"".  The <code>DBA_BLOCKERS</code> table has 14 entries whose session ids all correspond to the username used by our application code.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: It turns out that despite what I thought, another programmer was indeed accessing the database at the same time as me.  So what's the best way to detect this in the future?

Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>But, the completion only seems to work at the beginning of strings.  If you want to match the middle or end of a string readline doesn't work.</p>

<p>I would like to autocomplete strings, in a command-line python program by matching what I type with any of the strings in a list of available strings.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A good example of the type of autocompletion I would like to have is the type that happens in GMail when you type in the To field.  If you type one of your contacts' last name, it will come up just as well as if you typed her first name.  </li>
<li>Some use of the up and down arrows or some other method to select from the matched strings may be needed (and not needed in the case of readline) and that is fine in my case.</li>
<li>My particular use case is a command-line program that sends emails.</li>
<li>Specific code examples would be very helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using terminal emulators like curses would be fine.  It only has to run on linux, not Mac or Windows.</p>

<p>Here is an example:
Say I have the following three strings in a list </p>

'Eden Jones &lt;ejones@domain.com&gt;', 
'Somebody Else &lt;somebody@domain.com&gt;']

<p>I found the functions bisect_left/right in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html"">bisect module</a>, but they still return a position even if the item is not in the list. That's perfectly fine for their intended usage, but I just want to know if an item is in the list or not (don't want to insert anything).</p>

<p>I thought of using <code>bisect_left</code> and then checking if the item at that position is equal to what I'm searching, but that seems cumbersome (and I also need to do bounds checking if the number can be larger than the largest number in my list). If there is a nicer method I'd like to know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> To clarify what I need this for: I'm aware that a dictionary would be very well suited for this, but I'm trying to keep the memory consumption as low as possible. My intended usage would be a sort of double-way look-up table. I have in the table a list of values and I need to be able to access the values based on their index.

</code></pre>

<p>How can one use generic views to edit Dog and/or Cat using the same form?</p>

<p>I.e. The <em>form</em> object that is passed to *animals/animal_form.html* will be Animal, and thus won't contain any of the specifics for the derived classes Dog and Cat. How could I have Django automatically pass a form for the child class to *animal/animals_form.html*?</p>

<p>Incidentally, I'm using <a href=""http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1031/"" rel=""nofollow"">Djangosnippets #1031</a> for ContentType management, so Animal would have a method named *as_leaf_class* that returns the derived class.</p>

<p>Clearly, one could create forms for each derived class, but that's quite a lot of unnecessary duplication (as the templates will all be generic -- essentially {{ form.as_p }}).</p>

<p>Incidentally, it's best to assume that Animal will probably be one of several unrelated base classes with the same problem, so an ideal solution would be generic.</p>

I want it to be multithreaded because I want to have an in memory object cache that will be used by various http threads. My webserver does a lot of expensive stuff and computes some large arrays which needs to be cached in memory for future use to avoid recomputing. This is not possible in a multi-process web server environment. Storing this information in memcache is also not a good idea as the arrays are large and storing them in memcache would lead to deserialization of data coming from memcache apart from the additional overhead of IPC.</p>

869,213628,17498.0,2008-10-17T19:58:07Z,7,How to convert a C string (char array) into a Python string when there are non-ASCII characters in the string?,"<p>I have embedded a Python interpreter in a C program.  Suppose the C program reads some bytes from a file into a char array and learns (somehow) that the bytes represent text with a certain encoding (e.g., ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252, or UTF-8).  How do I decode the contents of this char array into a Python string?</p>

<p>The Python string should in general be of type <code>unicode</code>âfor instance, a <code>0x93</code> in Windows-1252 encoded input becomes a <code>u'\u0201c'</code>.</p>

<p>I have attempted to use <code>PyString_Decode</code>, but it always fails when there are non-ASCII characters in the string.  Here is an example that fails:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
     char c_string[] = { (char)0x93, 0 };
     PyObject *py_string;

     Py_Initialize();

     py_string = PyString_Decode(c_string, 1, ""windows_1252"", ""replace"");
     if (!py_string) {
          PyErr_Print();
          return 1;
     }
     return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is <code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u201c' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</code>, which indicates that the <code>ascii</code> encoding is used even though we specify <code>windows_1252</code> in the call to <code>PyString_Decode</code>.</p>

<p>The following code works around the problem by using <code>PyString_FromString</code> to create a Python string of the undecoded bytes, then calling its <code>decode</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
     char c_string[] = { (char)0x93, 0 };
     PyObject *raw, *decoded;

     Py_Initialize();

     raw = PyString_FromString(c_string);
     printf(""Undecoded: "");
     PyObject_Print(raw, stdout, 0);
     printf(""\n"");
     decoded = PyObject_CallMethod(raw, ""decode"", ""s"", ""windows_1252"");
     Py_DECREF(raw);

     PyObject_Print(decoded, stdout, 0);
     printf(""\n"");

<p>I thought wow, this will be easy because the data is in the column below type=body.  Counting down I knew that in the data rows I would need to get the values in columns [3, 7, 11, 15].  So I set out to accomplish that using this code:</p>

<pre><code>indexComment = souptoGetColIndex.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))
indexRow=indexComment[0].findParent()
indexCells=indexRow.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))

<p>what I got back was collist=[0, 3, 7, 7, 15]</p>

<p>It turns out I think that because cells in the 7th and 11th position looked exactly alike the same index position was returned.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with this, clearly I had to make them look different.  So what I did was make them look different by first using a readlines to read each line of the file in and change the blank spaces to a random integer.</p>

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(random.randint(1,14567))))

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(toGetColIndex.index(each))))

<p>Nonetheless, each of these approaches gets me a list with the colindex for the location of my headers for each column and to use on the data rows.

<p>Now the problem is this: 
'MyFunc' executes fine, i can see the print of 'result'.
What i cannot do is read 'result' back from the C++ code. The extract command never finds 'result' in any namespace.
I tried defining 'result' as a global, i even tried returning a tuple, but i cannot get it to work.</p>

<ul>
<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>
<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>
<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>
<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>
</ul>

<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>

<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>

<p>Should I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT I</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.</p>

<p>Should I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)? Perhaps that is what I'm missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p>

<p>I haven't quite decided which framework to go with, much less what production server to use, so it's kinda difficult for me to pin this down to a ""compare development server x to production server y.""  So with that said, let me make the question a little bit more precise:  In your past experience with a python framework, how much time did you have to spend getting your application up and running with a production system once its been developed on a development server?  Or did you skip the development server and develop your app on a server that's more like what you will use in production?</p>

<p>When I type shift-3 in the Python interactive shell, I seem to invoke the previous word function, i.e. the cursor will move to the start of the last âwordâ (i.e. space-delimited item) typed on the line. When Iâm back in the bash shell, typing shift-3 just produces a Â£, as expected.</p>

<p>This version of Python apparently uses editline for its interactive shell, as opposed to readline. Iâm guessing that one of the default editline key bindings binds shift-3 (or whatever editline sees when I type shift-3) to the ed-prev-word command.</p>

<p>Iâve tried a few things in my ~/.editrc file to remove this binding, and they donât have any effect:</p>

When I try to run the application, I get an error message that just says ""see the logfile for details"". The only problem is, the log file is empty. </p>

<p>The closest error I've seen is ""The following modules appear to be missing"" but I'm not using any of those modules as far as I know (especially since they seem to be of databases I'm not using) but digging up on Google suggests that these are relatively benign warnings.</p>

<p>I've written and packaged a console application as well as a wxpython one with py2exe and both applications have compiled and run successfully. I am using a new python toolkit called dabo, which in turn makes uses of wxpython modules so I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Where do I start investigating the problem since obviously the log file hasn't been too useful?   </p>

<p><b>Edit 1:</b> 
The python version is 2.5. py2exe is 0.6.8. There were no significant build errors. The only one was the bit about ""The following modules appear to be missing..."" which were non critical errors since the packages listed were ones I was definitely not using and shouldn't stop the execution of the app either. Running the executable produced a logfile which was completely empty. Previously it had an error about locales which I've since fixed but clearly something is wrong as the executable wasn't running. The setup.py file is based quite heavily on the original setup.py generated by running their ""app wizard"" and looking at the example that Ed Leafe and some others posted. Yes, I have a log file and it's not printing anything for me to use, which is why I'm asking if there's any other troubleshooting avenue I've missed which will help me find out what's going on. </p>

<p>I have even written a bare bones test application which simply produces a bare bones GUI - an empty frame with some default menu options. The code written itself is only 3 lines and the rest is in the 3rd party toolkit. Again, that compiled into an exe (as did my original app) but simply did not run. There were no error output in the run time log file either. </p>

<p>I think it should be possible, PySmell's <code>idehelper.py</code> does a majority of the complex stuff, it should just be a case of giving it the current line, offering up the completions (the bit I am not sure about) and then replacing the line with the selected one.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import idehelper
&gt;&gt;&gt; # The path is where my PYSMELLTAGS file is located:
&gt;&gt;&gt; PYSMELLDICT = idehelper.findPYSMELLDICT(""/Users/dbr/Desktop/pysmell/"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = idehelper.detectCompletionType("""", """" 1, 2, """", PYSMELLDICT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; completions = idehelper.findCompletions(""proc"", PYSMELLDICT, options)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print completions
[{'dup': '1', 'menu': 'pysmell.pysmell', 'kind': 'f', 'word': 'process', 'abbr': 'process(argList, excluded, output, verbose=False)'}]
</code></pre>

<p>It'll never be perfect, but it would be extremely useful (even if just for completing the stdlib modules, which should never change, so you wont have to constantly regenerate the PYSMELLTAGS file whenever you add a function)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Progressing! I have the utter-basics of completion in place - barely works, but it's close..</p>

<p>I ran <code>python pysmells.py /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/*.py -O /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/pysmell/PYSMELLTAGS</code></p>

<p>Place the following in a TextMate bundle script, set ""input: entire document"", ""output: insert as text"", ""activation: key equivalent: alt+esc"", ""scope selector: source.python""</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import sys
from pysmell import idehelper

CUR_WORD = os.environ.get(""TM_CURRENT_WORD"")

cur_file = os.environ.get(""TM_FILEPATH"")
orig_source = sys.stdin.read()
line_no = int(os.environ.get(""TM_LINE_NUMBER""))
cur_col = int(os.environ.get(""TM_LINE_INDEX""))

# PYSMELLS is currently in site-packages/pysmell/
PYSMELLDICT = idehelper.findPYSMELLDICT(""/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/pysmell/blah"")
options = idehelper.detectCompletionType(cur_file, orig_source, line_no, cur_col, """", PYSMELLDICT)
completions = idehelper.findCompletions(CUR_WORD, PYSMELLDICT, options)

if len(completions) &gt; 0:
    new_word = completions[0]['word']
    new_word = new_word.replace(CUR_WORD, """", 1) # remove what user has already typed
    print new_word

<p>I tried to figure out what was happening. My application does not open any file or any socket etc. My file only opens couple of berkeley dbs. I investigated this issue further. I saw the file descriptors used by my cherrypy process with id 4536  in /proc/4536/fd/
Initially there were new sockets created and cleaned up properly but after an hour I found that it had about 509 sockets that were not cleaned. All the sockets were in CLOSE_WAIT state. I got this information using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>netstat -ap | grep ""4536"" | grep CLOSE_WAIT | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>CLOSE_WAIT state means that the remote client has closed the connection. Why is cherrypy then not closing the socket and free the file descriptors? What can I do to resolve the problem? </p>

<p>I tried to play with the following:</p>

<pre><code>cherrypy.config.update({'server.socketQueueSize': '10'})
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that this would restrict the number of sockets open at any time to 10 but it was not effective at all. This is the only config I have set, so , rest of the configs hold their default values.</p>

<p>Could somebody throw light on this? Do you think its a bug in cherrypy? How can I resolve it? Is there a way I can close these sockets myself?</p>

            self.counter += 1

d.something = 'one'

<p>I find it more aesthetically pleasing than <code>d['something']</code>. Note that accessing an undefined key returns None instead of raising an exception, which is also nice.</p>

<p>Update: Smashery makes a good point, which mhawke expands on for an easier solution. I'm wondering if there are any undesirable side effects of using <strong>dict</strong> instead of defining a new dictionary; if not, I like mhawke's solution a lot.</p>

<p>However, I'm realizing that the limitations of the wizard are making it difficult to design ""elegant"" logic flow. For example, because all pages of the wizard are initalized at the same time, I can't have the values entered in one page available to the next one. I have to put a button on each page to get the values from a previous page rather than simply having fields auto-populated.</p>

<p>I've thought about alternatives to using the wizard. I think the best idea is to have some buttons on one panel that change the information on another panel, e.g. a splitter window.</p>

<p>However, I can't find any documentation in wxPython on how to dynamically change the panel. Everything I've found so far is really pretty static, hence the use of the wizard. Even the ""wxPython in Action"" book doesn't mention it.</p>

<p>Are there any tutorials for making ""dynamic panels"" or better management of a wizard?</p>

There are hundreds of ways to tune an application, but how do we collect, organize, process, visualize the consequences of each experiment. </p>

<p>I have been looking for several months for an open source application performance engineering/profiling framework similar in concept to Mozilla's <a href=""http://graphs.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Perftastic</a> where I can develop/build/test/profile hundreds of incarnations of different tuning experiments. </p>

<p>Some requirements:</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>SUSE32 and SUSE64</p>

<h2>Data Format</h2>

<p>Very flexible, compact, simple, hierarchical. There are several possibilities including</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"" rel=""nofollow"">CSV</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool"" rel=""nofollow"">RRD</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_buffers"" rel=""nofollow"">Protocol Buffers</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON</a></li>
<li>No XML. There is lots of data and XML is tooo verbose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Acquisition</h2>

<p>Flexible and Customizable plugins. There is lots of data to collect from the application including performance data from /proc, sys time, wall time, cpu utilization, memory profile, leaks, valgrind logs, arena fragmentation, I/O, localhost sockets, binary size, open fds, etc. And some from the host system. My language of choice for this is Python, and I would develop these plugins to monitor and/or parse data in all different formats and store them in the data format of the framework.</p>

<h2>Tagging</h2>

<p>All experiments would be tagged including data like GCC version and compile options, platform, host, app options, experiment, build tag, etc.</p>

<h2>Graphing</h2>

<p>History, Comparative, Hierarchical, Dynamic and Static.</p>

<ul>
<li>The application builds are done by a custom CI sever which releases a new app version several times per day the last 3 years straight. This is why we need a continuous trend analysis. When we add new features, make bug fixes, change build options, we want to automatically gather profiling data and see the trend. This is where generating various static builds is needed. </li>
<li>For analysis <a href=""http://graphs.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla dynamic graphs</a> are great for doing comparative graphing. It would be great to have comparative graphing between different tags. For example compare N build versions, compare platforms, compare build options, etc. </li>
<li>We have a test suite of 3K tests, data will be gathered per test, and grouped from inter-test data, to per test, to per tagged group, to complete regression suite. </li>
<li>Possibilities include <a href=""http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/index.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RRDTool</a>, <a href=""http://www.orcaware.com/orca/example_sites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Orca</a>, <a href=""http://graphite.wikidot.com/screen-shots"" rel=""nofollow"">Graphite</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis on a grouping basis</h2>

<ul>
<li>Min</li>
<li>Max</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Avg</li>
<li>Standard Deviation</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this would be presented and controlled through a app server, preferably Django or TG would be best.</p>

<p>Basically: is there any Continuous Integration systems aimed at python, that produce lots of shiny graphs and the likes?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this time the Jenkins project has replaced Hudson as the community version of the package. The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org"">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I'll stick with Hudson. <a href=""http://integrityapp.com/"">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=""http://buildbot.net/trac"">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>

<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download Hudson from <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>
<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>
<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click ""Update"" or similar</li>
<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>
<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>
<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it's not already</li>
<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>
<li>Check ""Publish JUnit test result report"" and set ""Test report XMLs"" to <code>**/nosetests.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That's all that's required. You can setup email notifications, and <a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins"">the plugins</a> are worth a look. A few I'm currently using for Python projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/SLOCCount+Plugin"">SLOCCount plugin</a> to count lines of code (and graph it!) - you need to install <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/"">sloccount</a> separately</li>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations"">Violations</a> to parse the PyLint output (you can setup warning thresholds, graph the number of violations over each build)</li>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Cobertura+Plugin"">Cobertura</a> can parse the coverage.py output. Nosetest can gather coverage while running your tests, using <code>nosetests --with-coverage</code> (this writes the output to <code>**/coverage.xml</code>)</li>

<p>Here is an (overcomplicated?) example.  If people have a simpler one that demos it, I'd like to hear it.   The issue:  the list comprehensions using next() are filled with the result from the last iteration.  </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: The Problem:</p>

<p>What exactly is going on with this, and how do I fix this?  Do I have to use a standard for loop? Clearly the function is running the correct number of times, but the list comprehensions end up with the <em>final</em> value instead of the result of each loop.</p>

<p>One thing that I do very commonly when experimenting with code is to call a function from within the debugger, and step into that function, like so:</p>

<pre><code># NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM EXITS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT CALLING FOO()
~&gt; cat -n /tmp/show_perl.pl
1  #!/usr/local/bin/perl

3  sub foo {

5      print ""bye\n"";
6  }
7
8  exit 0;

~&gt; perl -d /tmp/show_perl.pl

Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

  h q, h R or h O to get additional info.

<p>This is incredibly useful when trying to step through a function's handling of various different inputs to figure out why it fails.  However, it does not seem to work in either pdb or pydb (I'd show an equivalent python example to the one above but it results in a large exception stack dump).</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I missing something?</li>
<li>Is there a python debugger that would indeed let me do this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously I could put the calls in the code myself, but I love working interactively, eg. not having to start from scratch when I want to try calling with a slightly different set of arguments.</p>

However I've come upon some.. negativity in relation to fine-grained control of permissions to the CRUD interface.</p>

<p>What I'm writing is an Intranet client management web-app. The organisation is about 6 tiers, and I need to restrict access to client groups based on tiers. Continually expanding. I have a fairly good idea how I'm going to do this, but am not sure if I'll be able to integrate it well into the pre-built admin interface. </p>

<p>I've done absolutely zero Django development otherwise I'd probably have a better idea on whether this would work or not. I probably won't use Django if the generated admin interface is going to be useless to this project - but like I said, there is a heavy reliance on fine-grained custom permissions.</p>

<p>Will Django let me build custom permissions/rules and integrate it seamlessly into the admin CRUD interface?</p>

<p>Update One: I want to use the admin app to minimise the repitition of generating CRUD interfaces, so yes I consider it a must have.</p>

<p>Update Two:</p>

<p>I want to describe the permissions required for this project.</p>

<p>A client can belong to one or many 'stores'. Full time employees should only be able to edit clients at their store (even if they belong to another store). However, they should not be able to see/edit clients at another store. Casuals should only be able to view clients based on what store they are rostered too (or if the casual is logged in as the store user - more likely).</p>

<p>Management above them need to be able to see all employees for the stores they manage, nothing more.</p>

<p>Senior management should be able to edit ALL employees and grant permissions below themselves.</p>

<p>After reading the django documentation, it says you can't (autmoatically) set permissions for a sub-set of a group. Only the entire group. Is it easy enough to mock up your own permissions for this purpose?</p>

<p>However, I can't make my mind up on how to distinguish between methods for external use or subclassing use.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class EventMixin(object):
    def subscribe(self, **kwargs):
        '''kwargs should be a dict of event -&gt; callable, to be specialized in the subclass'''

<p>In this example, I want to make it clear that subscribe is a method to be used by external users of the class/object, while event is a method that should not be called from the outside, but rather by subclass implementations.</p>

<p>Right now, I consider both part of the public API, hence don't use any underscores.  However, for this particular situation, it would feel cleaner to, for example, use no underscores for the external API, one underscore for the subclassable API, and two underscores for the private/internal API.  However, that would become unwieldy because then the internal API would need to be invoked as</p>

Have a tuple (like the one I commented out) and iterate over it 3 times, each time making a new value (for each skill) based on the modifier for each particular range. The resulting value is then automatically assigned to it's respective variable.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>This question is similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code</a></p>

<p>The differences being:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to add the revision number to Python</p></li>
<li><p>I want the revision of the repository (not the checked out file)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I.e. I would like to extract the Revision number from the return from 'svn info', likeso:</p>

<p>$ svn info</p>

<pre><code>Path: .
URL: svn://localhost/B/trunk
Repository Root: svn://localhost/B
Revision: 375
Node Kind: directory
Schedule: normal
Last Changed Author: bmh
Last Changed Rev: 375
Last Changed Date: 2008-10-27 12:09:00 -0400 (Mon, 27 Oct 2008)
</code></pre>

<p>I want a variable with 375 (the Revision). It's easy enough with put $Rev$ into a variable to keep track of changes on a file. However, I would like to keep track of the repository's version, and I understand (and it seems based on my tests) that $Rev$ only updates when the file changes.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts turn to using the svn/libsvn module built in to Python, though I can't find any documentation on or examples of how to use them.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I've thought calling 'svn info' and regex'ing the code out, though that seems rather brutal. :)</p>

<p>Help would be most appreciated.</p>

They're especially useful when setting up chains of operations to perform on a big pile of data--I often use them when processing DSV files.</p>

<p><strong>So when is it <em>not</em> a good time to use a generator, or a generator expression, or an <code>itertools</code> function?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When should I prefer <code>zip()</code> over <code>itertools.izip()</code>, or</li>
<li><code>range()</code> over <code>xrange()</code>, or</li>
<li><code>[x for x in foo]</code> over <code>(x for x in foo)</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, we eventually need to ""resolve"" a generator into actual data, usually by creating a list or iterating over it with a non-generator loop. Sometimes we just need to know the length. This isn't what I'm asking.</p>

<p>We use generators so that we're not assigning new lists into memory for interim data. This especially makes sense for large datasets. Does it make sense for small datasets too? Is there a noticeable memory/cpu trade-off?</p>

The problem came with a natural recursive solution. Now it happens that, even for relatively small input, the sequences are several thousands, thus I would prefer to use my algorithm as a generator instead of using it to fill a list with all the sequences.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Suppose we want to compute all the permutations of a string with a recursive function. The following naive algorithm takes an extra argument 'storage' and appends a permutation to it whenever it finds one:</p>

<pre><code>def getPermutations(string, storage, prefix=""""):
   if len(string) == 1:
      storage.append(prefix + string)   # &lt;-----
   else:
      for i in range(len(string)):
         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], storage, prefix+string[i])

storage = []
getPermutations(""abcd"", storage)
for permutation in storage: print permutation
</code></pre>

<p>(Please don't care about inefficiency, this is only an example.)</p>

<p>Now I want to turn my function into a generator, i.e. to yield a permutation instead of appending it to the storage list:</p>

<pre><code>def getPermutations(string, prefix=""""):
   if len(string) == 1:
      yield prefix + string             # &lt;-----
   else:

         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], prefix+string[i])

for permutation in getPermutations(""abcd""):
   print permutation
</code></pre>

<p>This code does <em>not</em> work (the function behaves like an empty generator).</p>

<p>Am I missing something?
Is there a way to turn the above recursive algorithm into a generator <em>without replacing it with an iterative one</em>?</p>

We use C# and ASP.NET for basically all of our development. 80% or more of our projects are web applications. It seems natural that we would look at some of the nice dynamic web languages (Ruby, Python, etc), and with things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironruby"" rel=""nofollow"">IronRuby</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironpython"" rel=""nofollow"">IronPython</a>, I started seriously investigating.</p>

<p>I love Python. It's a beautiful, expressive language. It's a joy to code in, for sure. The multitude of python modules and frameworks make it very appealing. Problem is, I cannot think of any specific problems, any specific hurdles that would <b>require</b> a language like Python. ASP.NET gives us RAD, it gives us a full-featured framework and all that good stuff. Also, we all already know C# and have lots of projects in C#, learning a new language just <i>because</i> doesn't quite work. </p>

<p>Edit again: Let me also mention that my boss prompted ME to investigate this. He has put aside hours to research these languages, find a good one, learn it, and then figure out how we can use it. I'm at the last step here, I do not need a lecture on why I should consider my motivation for changing something my company does because they do it for a reason. </p>

1047,249110,32638.0,2008-10-30T02:18:32Z,16,Django: Arbitrary number of unnamed urls.py parameters,"<p>I have a Django model with a large number of fields and 20000+ table rows.  To facilitate human readable URLs and the ability to break down the large list into arbitrary sublists, I would like to have a URL that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/browse/&lt;name1&gt;/&lt;value1&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;/&lt;value2&gt;/ .... etc ....
</code></pre>

<p>where 'name' maps to a model attribute and 'value' is the search criteria for that attribute.  Each ""name"" will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match.</p>

<p>Now, this could be handled with GET parameters, but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user's sake and the search engines.  These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model, so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs.</p>

<p>Ideally each name/value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code>, etc.  However, I don't believe it's possible to defined named patterns via a regex's matched text.  Am I wrong there?</p>

<p>So, it seems I need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/(?:([\w]+)/([\w]+)/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems this should match any sets of two name/value pairs.  While it matches it successfully, it only passes the last name/value pair as parameters to the view function.  My guess is that each match is overwriting the previous match.  Under the guess that the containing (?:...)+ is causing it, I tried a simple repeating pattern instead:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/([\w]+/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>... and got the same problem, but this time <code>*args</code> only includes the last matched pattern.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of Django's url dispatcher, and/or Python's regex support?  It seems either of these methods should work.  Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional (.*) pattern?</p>

When a user installs PySmell the usual way, these files get copied in the actual egg, and the user has to fish them out and place them in his .vim or .emacs directories. What I want is either asking the user, post-installation, where would he like these files copied, or even just a message printing the location of the files and what should he do with them.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I want to changed the request verb of a request in the case a
parameter _method is provided, for example if a POST request comes in
with a parameter _method=PUT, I need to change the request to call the
put method of the handler. This is to cope with the way prototype.js
works with verbs like PUT and DELETE(workaround for IE). Here is my
first attempt:</p>

<pre>
class MyRequestHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
   def initialize(self, request, response):
       m = request.get('_method')
       if m:
           request.method = m.upper()
       webapp.RequestHandler.initialize(self, request, response)
</pre>

<p>The problem is, for some reason whenever the redirect is done, the
self.request.params are emptied by the time the handling method(put or
delete) is called, even though they were populated when initialize was
called. Anyone have a clue why this is? As a workaround I thought I
could clone the params at initialize() time, but .copy() did not work,
and I haven't found a way to do that either.</p>

<p>What are the benefits/limitations of using a browser-based interface for a stand-alone application vs. using a normal GUI framework?</p>

<p>I'm working on a Python program currently implement with wxPython for the GUI. The application is simply user-entry forms and dialogs. I am considering moving to PyQt because of the widgets it has (for future expansion), then I realized I could probably just use a browser to do much of the same stuff.</p>

<p>The application currently doesn't require Internet access, though it's a possibility in the future. I was thinking of using <a href=""http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/"">Karrigell</a> for the web framework if I go browser-based.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> For clarification, as of right now the application would be browser-based, not web-based. All the information would be stored locally on the client computer; no server calls would need to be made and no Internet access required (it may come later though). It would simply be a browser GUI instead of a wxPython/PyQt GUI. Hope that makes sense.</p>

The script also creates an html index file with links to each of the snips.  So I can click the hyperlink to see the file, make a note in a spreadsheet to  indicate if the file is correct or not and then use the back button in the browser to take me back to the index list.  </p>

<p>I was sitting here wondering if I could somehow create a delete button in the browser next to the hyperlink.

But now, I have to change the ""verbose_name"" of that AutoField to something other than ""id"". I cannot override the ""id"" field the usual way, because that would require dropping/resetting the entire model and its data (which is strictly not an option). I cannot find another way around it. Does what I want even possible to achieve? If you may suggest any alternatives that would get me away with what I want without having to drop the model/table, I'd be happy.</p>

For example (in Python syntax):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict = { re.compile(r'foo.') : 12, re.compile(r'^FileN.*$') : 35 }
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['food']
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['foot in my mouth']
12

35
</code></pre>

<p>(Obviously the above example won't work as written in Python, but that's the sort of thing I'd like to be able to do.)</p>

<p>I can think of a naive way to implement this, in which I iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them, but then I lose the O(1) lookup time of a hash map and instead have O(n), where n is the number of keys in my dictionary.  This is potentially a big deal, as I expect this dictionary to grow very large, and I will need to search it over and over again (actually I'll need to iterate over it for every line I read in a text file, and the files can be hundreds of megabytes in size).</p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this, without resorting to O(n) efficiency?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you know of a way to accomplish this sort of a lookup in a database, that would be great, too.</p>

<p>(Any programming language is fine -- I'm using Python, but I'm more interested in the data structures and algorithms here.)</p>

<p>Someone pointed out that more than one match is possible, and that's absolutely correct.  Ideally in this situation I'd like to return a list or tuple containing all of the matches.  I'd settle for the first match, though.</p>

<p>I can't see O(1) being possible in that scenario; I'd settle for anything less than O(n), though.  Also, the underlying data structure could be anything, but the basic behavior I'd like is what I've written above: lookup a string, and return the value(s) that match the regular expression keys.</p>

<p>For our customer we have created (as part of a larger application) a
graphical designer which they can use to build ""scenario's"".</p>

<p>These scenario's consist of ""Composites"" which in turn consist
of ""Commands"". These command objects all derive from CommandBase and
implement an interface called ICompilable.</p>

<p>The scenario class also implements ICompilable. When Compile() is called
on a command an array of bytes is returned which can then be send to the device
for which they are intended (can't disclose to much info about that hardware, sorry)</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea:</p>

<pre><code>var scenario = new Scenario();

scenario.Add(new DelayCommand(1));
scenario.Add(new CountWithValueCommand(1,ActionEnum.Add,1));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new WaitCommand(3));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new SkipIfCommand(1,OperatorEnum.SmallerThan,10));
scenario.Add(new JumpCommand(2));

byte[] compiledData = scenario.Compile();
</code></pre>

<p>The graphical designer abstracts all this from the user and allows
him (or her) to simply drag en drop composites onto the designer surface.
(Composites can group commands so we can provide building blocks for returning tasks)</p>

<p>Recently our customer came to us and said, ""well the designer is really cool,
but we have some people who would rather have some kind of programming language,
just something simple.""</p>

However I am having some problems when trying to call a method from a class not directly added as a handler to the XML-RPC server. Please see my example below:</p>

<p>I have a test Ruby XML-RPC server as follows:</p>

<pre><code>require ""xmlrpc/server""

class ExampleBar
  def bar()
    return ""hello world!""
  end
end

class ExampleFoo
  def foo()
    return ExampleBar.new
  end

  def test()
    return ""test!""
  end
end

s = XMLRPC::Server.new( 9090 )

s.add_introspection

s.add_handler( ""example"", ExampleFoo.new )

s.serve
</code></pre>

<p>And I have a test Python XML-RPC Client as follows:</p>

<pre><code>import xmlrpclib

s = xmlrpclib.Server( ""http://127.0.0.1:9090/"" )

print s.example.foo().bar()
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect the python client to print ""hello world!"" as it is the equivalent of the following ruby code:</p>

<pre><code>example = ExampleFoo.new
puts example.foo().bar()
</code></pre>

<p>However it generates an error: ""xmlrpclib.ProtocolError: &lt;ProtocolError for 127.0.0.1:9090/: 500 Internal Server Error&gt;"".</p>

<p>print s.example.test() works fine.</p>

<p>I dont expect the new ExampleBar object to go over the wire but I would expect it to be 'cached' server side and the subsequent call to bar() to be honoured.</p>

<p>Can XML-RPC support this kind of usage or is it too basic?</p>

It happens that I want the compressed output to be deterministic, because that's often a really convenient property for things to have in general -- if some non-gzip-aware process is going to be looking for changes in the output, say, or if the output is going to be cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the output is different every time.  As far as I can tell, the only reason for this is the timestamp field in the gzip header, which the Python module always populates with the current time.  I don't think you're actually allowed to have a gzip stream without a timestamp in it, which is too bad.</p>

<p>In any case, there doesn't seem to be a way for the caller of Python's <code>gzip</code> module to supply the correct modification time of the underlying data.  (The actual <code>gzip</code> program seems to use the timestamp of the input file when possible.)  I imagine this is because basically the only thing that ever cares about the timestamp is the <code>gunzip</code> command when writing to a file -- and, now, me, because I want deterministic output.  Is that so much to ask?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SERVER&gt; &lt;SERVERKEY&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; &lt;FOLDERPATH&gt; &lt;RETENTION&gt; &lt;TRANSFERMODE&gt; &lt;OUTPUTPATH&gt; &lt;LOGTO&gt; &lt;OPTIONAL-MAXSIZE&gt; &lt;OPTIONAL-OFFSET&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Most of these fields are just simple words, but some of them can be paths, such as FOLDERPATH, OUTPUTPATH, these paths can also be paths with a filename and wildcard appended.</p>

<p>Retention is a number, and transfer mode can be bin or ascii. The issue is, LOGTO which can be a path with the logfile name appended to it or can be NO, which means no log file.</p>

<p>The main issue, is the optional arguments, they are both numbers, and OFFSET can't exist without MAXSIZE, but MAXSIZE can exist without offset.</p>

<p>Heres some examples:</p>

<pre><code>loveserver love copy /muffin* 20 bin C:\Puppies\ NO 256 300
loveserver love copy /muffin* 20 bin C:\Puppies\ NO 256
loveserver love copy /hats* 300 ascii C:\Puppies\no\ C:\log\love.log 256
</code></pre>

<p>Now the main issue, is that paths can have spaces in them, so if I use . to match everything, the regex ends up breaking, when parsing the optional arguments where the LOG destination ends up getting attached to the outputpath.</p>

<p>Also if I end up using . and start removing parts of it, the regex will start putting things where it shouldn't.</p>

<p>Heres my regex:</p>

<pre><code>^(\s+)?(?P&lt;SRCHOST&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;SRCKEY&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;COMMAND&gt;COPY)(\s+)(?P&lt;SRCDIR&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;RETENTION&gt;\d+)(\s+)(?P&lt;TRANSFER_MODE&gt;BIN|ASC|BINARY|ASCII)(\s+)(?P&lt;DSTDIR&gt;.+)(\s+)(?P&lt;LOGFILE&gt;.+)(\s+)?(?P&lt;SIZE&gt;\d+)?(\s+)?(?P&lt;OFFSET&gt;\d+)?$

These are, basically, stored as a plain text username, a password hash, and an associated salt for this hash.</p>

<p>These were all created by built in functions in ASP.NET's membership/role system.  Here's a row for a user named 'joe' and a password of 'password':</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>joe,kDP0Py2QwEdJYtUX9cJABg==,OJF6H4KdxFLgLu+oTDNFodCEfMA=</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've dumped this stuff into a CSV file and I'm attempting to get it into a usable format for Django which stores its passwords in this format:</p>

<p>[algo]$[salt]$[hash]</p>

<p>Where the salt is a plain string and the hash is the hex digest of an SHA1 hash.</p>

<p>So far I've been able to ascertain that ASP is storing these hashes and salts in a base64 format.  Those values above decode into binary strings.</p>

<p>We've used reflector to glean how ASP authenticates against these values:</p>

<pre><code>internal string EncodePassword(string pass, int passwordFormat, string salt)
{
    if (passwordFormat == 0)
    {
        return pass;
    }
    byte[] bytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(pass);
    byte[] src = Convert.FromBase64String(salt);
    byte[] dst = new byte[src.Length + bytes.Length];
    byte[] inArray = null;
    Buffer.BlockCopy(src, 0, dst, 0, src.Length);
    Buffer.BlockCopy(bytes, 0, dst, src.Length, bytes.Length);
    if (passwordFormat == 1)
    {
        HashAlgorithm algorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create(Membership.HashAlgorithmType);
        if ((algorithm == null) &amp;&amp; Membership.IsHashAlgorithmFromMembershipConfig)
        {
            RuntimeConfig.GetAppConfig().Membership.ThrowHashAlgorithmException();
        }
        inArray = algorithm.ComputeHash(dst);
    }
    else
    {
        inArray = this.EncryptPassword(dst);
    }
    return Convert.ToBase64String(inArray);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Eseentially, pulls in the salt from the DB and b64 decodes it into a binary representation.  It does a ""GetBytes"" on the raw password and then it concatinates them, salt first.</p>

<p>It then runs the SHA1 algorithm on this new string, base64 encodes it, and compares it against the value stored in the database.</p>

<p>I've attempted to write some code to try and reproduce these hashes in Python and I'm failing.  I won't be able to use them in Django until I can figure out how this translates over.  Here's how I'm testing:</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib
from base64 import b64decode, b64encode

b64salt = ""kDP0Py2QwEdJYtUX9cJABg==""
b64hash = ""OJF6H4KdxFLgLu+oTDNFodCEfMA=""
binsalt = b64decode(b64salt)
password_string = 'password'

m1 = hashlib.sha1()
# Pass in salt
m1.update(binsalt)
# Pass in password
m1.update(password_string)
# B64 encode the binary digest
if b64encode(m1.digest()) == b64hash:
    print ""Logged in!""
else:
    print ""Didn't match""
    print b64hash
    print b64encode(m1.digest())

<p>I'm wondering if anyone can see any flaws in my approach or can suggest an alternate method.  Perhaps you can take the algorithms above and the known password and salt above and produce the hash on your system?</p>

table = sqlalchemy.Table('stuff', md, autoload=True)
upd = table.update(values={table.c.foo:table.c.foo+1})

# snip creation of session object
for c in session.query(Stuff):
    c.foo = c.foo + 1
session.flush()
session.commit()

<p>Right now we just put out fingers in the air and make educated guesses based on what we already know about the system from experience.  As the product is put under more demanding conditions, this is proving to be inadequate for our needs going forward though.</p>

<p>I wrote a small piece of program in C, then compiled and objdumped the code. After that I inserted it to my python script, therefore the x86_64 code is correct:</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import cast, CFUNCTYPE, c_char_p, c_long

buffer = ''.join(map(chr, [ #0000000000000000 &lt;add&gt;:
  0x55,                     # push   %rbp
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,         # mov    %rsp,%rbp
  0x48, 0x89, 0x7d, 0xf8,   # mov    %rdi,-0x8(%rbp)
  0x48, 0x8b, 0x45, 0xf8,   # mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax
  0x48, 0x83, 0xc0, 0x0a,   # add    $0xa,%rax

]))

fptr = cast(c_char_p(buffer), CFUNCTYPE(c_long, c_long))
print fptr(1234)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, why does this script keeps doing segmentation fault whenever I run it?</p>

<p>I have yet a question about mprotect and no execution flag. It is said to protect against most basic security exploits like buffer overruns. But what is the real reason it's in use? You could just keep on writing until you hit the .text, then inject your instructions into a nice, PROT_EXEC -area. Unless, of course, you use a write protection in .text</p>

<p>But then, why have that PROT_EXEC everywhere anyway? Wouldn't it just help tremendously that your .text section is write protected?</p>

<li><p>Using a library such as <a href=""http://www.psychofx.com/psi/trac/wiki/"">PSI</a> (that currently seems not actively developed and not supported on multiple platform) or something like <a href=""http://www.i-scream.org/pystatgrab/"">pystatgrab</a> (again no activity since 2007 it seems and no support for Windows).</p></li>
<li><p>Using platform specific code such as using a <code>os.popen(""ps"")</code> or similar for the *nix systems and <code>MEMORYSTATUS</code> in <code>ctypes.windll.kernel32</code> (see <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/511491/"">this recipe on ActiveState</a>) for the Windows platform.

One of the problems I am dealing with is that I have situations where the colspans are different across header rows.  (Header rows are the rows that need to be combined to get the column headings in my jargon) That is one column may span a number of columns above or below it and the words need to be appended or prepended based on the spanning.  Below is a routine to do this.  I use BeautifulSoup to pull the colspans and to pull the contents of each cell in each row.  longHeader is the contents of the header row with the most items, spanLong is a list with the colspans of each item in the row.  This works but it is not looking very Pythonic.  </p>

<p>Alos-it is not going to work if the diff is &lt;0, I can fix that with the same approach I used to get this to work.  But before I do I wonder if anyone can quickly look at this and suggest a more Pythonic approach.  I am a long time SAS programmer and so I struggle to break the mold-well I will write code as if I am writing a SAS macro.</p>

1221,280324,18676.0,2008-11-11T08:24:00Z,9,"When is ""self"" required?","<p>I have been using classes for only a short while and when I write a method, I make all variables reference self, e.g. self.foo.</p>

<p>However, I'm looking through the <em>wxPython in Action</em> book and notice that ""self"" isn't used all the time. For example:</p>

<pre><code> import wx
 class TextFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, 'Text Entry Example',
            size=(300, 100))
        panel = wx.Panel(self, -1)
        basicLabel = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, ""Basic Control:"")
        basicText = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, ""I've entered some text!"",
            size=(175, -1))
        basicText.SetInsertionPoint(0)
        pwdLabel = wx.StaticText(panel, -1, ""Password:"")
        pwdText = wx.TextCtrl(panel, -1, ""password"", size=(175, -1),
            style=wx.TE_PASSWORD)
        sizer = wx.FlexGridSizer(cols=2, hgap=6, vgap=6)
        sizer.AddMany([basicLabel, basicText, pwdLabel, pwdText])
        panel.SetSizer(sizer)

<p>The one below does use ""self"".</p>

<pre><code>import wx
class ButtonFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, 'Button Example',
            size=(300, 100))
        panel = wx.Panel(self, -1)
        self.button = wx.Button(panel, -1, ""Hello"", pos=(50, 20))

        self.button.SetDefault()
    def OnClick(self, event):
        self.button.SetLabel(""Clicked"")

<p>If I remember correctly, ""self"" is reference to a particular instance of the class, so when is it not necessary? Is there a general rule of thumb?</p>

It works, but how I can handle cases where user puts characters that have meaning in regex?

I can run <code>replace</code> on user input and replace the <code>(</code> with <code>\(</code> and the <code>)</code> with <code>\)</code> but the problem is I will need to do replace for every possible regex symbol.

1223,280797,,2008-11-11T12:51:43Z,16,Calculate poisson probability percentage,"<p>When you use the POISSON function in Excel (or in OpenOffice Calc), it takes two arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>an integer</li>
<li>an 'average' number</li>
</ul>

<p>and returns a float.</p>

<p>In Python (I tried RandomArray and NumPy) it returns an array of random poisson numbers.
What I really want is the percentage that this event will occur (it is a constant number and the array has every time different numbers - so is it an average?).</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>print poisson(2.6,6)
</code></pre>

<p>returns <code>[1 3 3 0 1 3]</code> (and every time I run it, it's different).</p>

<p>The number I get from calc/excel is 3.19 (<code>POISSON(6,2.16,0)*100</code>).</p>

1226,281922,35247.0,2008-11-11T19:38:34Z,4,How can I do synchronous rpc calls,"<p>I'm building a program that has a class used locally, but I want the same class to be used the same way over the network. This means I need to be able to make synchronous calls to any of its public methods. The class reads and writes files, so I think XML-RPC is too much overhead. I created a basic rpc client/server using the examples from twisted, but I'm having trouble with the client.</p>

<pre><code>c = ClientCreator(reactor, Greeter)
c.connectTCP(self.host, self.port).addCallback(request)
reactor.run()
</code></pre>

<p>This works for a single call, when the data is received I'm calling reactor.stop(), but if I make any more calls the reactor won't restart. Is there something else I should be using for this? maybe a different twisted module or another framework?</p>

<p>(I'm not including the details of how the protocol works, because the main point is that I only get one call out of this.)</p>

<p>Addendum &amp; Clarification:</p>

<p>I shared a google doc with notes on what I'm doing. <a href=""http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv9rsfd_37ftshgpgz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv9rsfd_37ftshgpgz</a></p>

<p>I have a version written that uses fuse and can combine multiple local folders into the fuse mount point. The file access is already handled within a class, so I want to have servers that give me network access to the same class. After continuing to search, I suspect pyro (<a href=""http://pyro.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a>) might be what I'm really looking for (simply based on reading their home page right now) but I'm open to any suggestions.</p>

<p>I could achieve similar results by using an nfs mount and combining it with my local folder, but I want all of the peers to have access to the same combined filesystem, so that would require every computer to bee an nfs server with a number of nfs mounts equal to the number of computers in the network.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
I have decided to use rpyc as it gave me exactly what I was looking for. A server that keeps an instance of a class that I can manipulate as if it was local. If anyone is interested I put my project up on Launchpad (<a href=""http://launchpad.net/dstorage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://launchpad.net/dstorage</a>).</p>

<p>For example, suppose you had a class Foo, and were testing a method bar, using data from a list called testdata:</p>

<p>If the test failed, I might want to output t1, t2 and/or f, to see why this particular data resulted in a failure. By output, I mean that the variables can be accessed like any other variables, after the test has been run.</p>

1.0x +5.0y -3.0z =-6.0
2.0x +2.0y +5.0z =7.0

f.close()

j=0
for line in lines:
    bits = string.split(line, ',')

            #print s[i]
    b.append(s)
    y.append(float(bits[len(bits)-1]))
</code></pre>

<p>I need to solve using gauss-seidel so I need to rearrange the equations for x, y, and z:</p>

<pre><code>x=(11+2y-1z)/4
y=(-6-x+3z)/5
z=(7-2x-2y)/7
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code I use to rearrange the equations. <code>b</code> is a matrix of coefficients and <code>y</code> is the answer vector:</p>

<pre><code>def equations(b,y):
    i=0
    eqn=[]
    row=[]
    while(i&lt;len(b)):
        j=0
        row=[]
        while(j&lt;len(b)):
            if(i==j):
                row.append(y[i]/b[i][i])
            else:

            j=j+1
        eqn.append(row)
        i=i+1
    return eqn
</code></pre>

<p>However the answers I get back aren't precise to the decimal place.</p>

<p>For example, upon rearranging the second equation from above, I should get:</p>

<pre><code>y=-1.2-.2x+.6z

I figured that keys did not need to be unique within a section, otherwise the parser would just return a mapping. I designed my config file schema around this assumption, then sadly realized that this is not the case:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; from StringIO import StringIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; fh = StringIO(""""""

&gt;&gt;&gt; print parser.items('Some Section')
[('spam', 'ham')]

<blockquote>
  <p>Sections are normally stored in a
  builtin dictionary. An alternative
  dictionary type can be passed to the
  ConfigParser constructor. For example,
  if a dictionary type is passed that
  sorts its keys, the sections will be
  sorted on write-back, as will be the
  keys within each section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To keep my existing configuration file scheme (which I really like now ;) I'm thinking of passing a mapping-like object as mentioned above that accumulates values instead of clobbering them. Is there a simpler way to prevent key/value collapse that I'm missing? Instead of making a crazy adapter (that could break if <code>ConfigParser</code>'s implementation changes) should I just write a variant of the <code>ConfigParser</code> itself?</p>

<p>I feel like this may be one of those 'duh' moments where I'm only seeing the difficult solutions.</p>

The upshot of those was that I was building a prototype of an AI-based application for the web, and I wondered what language(s) to use. The conclusion seemed to be that I should go for something like python and then convert any critical bits into something faster like Java or C/C++.</p>

<p>That sounds fine to me, but I'm wondering now whether python is really the right language to use for building a web application. Most web applications I've worked on in the past were C/C++ CGI and then php. The php I found much easier to work with as it made linking the user interface to the back-end so much easier, and also it made more logical sense to me. </p>

<p>I've not used python before, but what I'm basically wondering is how easy is CGI programming in python? Will I have to go back to the tedious way of doing it in C/C++ where you have to store HTML code in templates and have the CGI read them in and replace special codes with appropriate values or is it possible to have the templates <em>be</em> the code as with php?</p>

<p>I'm probably asking a deeply ignorant question here, for which I apologise, but hopefully someone will know what I'm getting at! My overall question is: is writing web applications in python a good idea, and is it as easy as it is with php?</p>

if '### SERVER' in linelist[i]:
	#do server parsing stuff

	packet = linelist[i:find(""\n\n"", i, len(linelist))]

<p>linelist is a list created using the readlines() method, so every line in the file is an element in the list. I'm iterating through it for all occurances of ""### SERVER"", then grabbing all lines after it until the next empty line(which signifies the end of the packet). I must be doing something wrong, because not only is find() not working, but I have a feeling there's a better way to grab everything between ### SERVER and the next occurance of a blank line.</p>

<p>It uses simple TCP connections and spends a lot of time waiting for packets to come back (up to half a second). Thus the threads don't need to fully execute (i.e. first half sends a packet, context switch, does stuff, comes back to thread which has network data waiting for it).</p>

<p>I suspect I can improve performance by modifying the <code>sys.setcheckinterval</code> from the default of 100 (which lets up to 100 bytecodes execute before switching to another thread).</p>

<p>But without knowing how many bytecodes are actually executing in a thread or function I'm flying blind and simply guessing values, testing and relying on the testing shows a measurable difference (which is difficult since the amount of code being executed is minimal; a simple socket connection, thus network jitter will likely affect any measurements more than changing sys.setcheckinterval).</p>

<p>Thus I would like to find out how many bytecodes are in certain code executions (i.e. total for a function or in execution of a thread) so I can  make more intelligent guesses at what to set sys.setcheckinterval to.</p>

1321,298446,11522.0,2008-11-18T11:05:53Z,0,Looping in Django forms,"<p>I've just started building a prototype application in Django. I started out by working through the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">Django app tutorial on the Django site</a> which was pretty helpful, and gave me what I needed to get started. Now I have a couple of what I hope are very simple questions:</p>

<p>I want to put a loop into views.py, looping over a set of variables that have been passed in from a form. So I have a load of items in the HTML form, each of which has a SELECT drop-down list for people to select a score from 0-10, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""score1""&gt;
  &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have, let's say, 100 of these variables, score1, score2, score3, ..., score99, score100. When the form is submitted, I want to loop through each of these variables and see if it's been set (i.e. is not 0) and if so, I want to store that value in a suitable place in the database. My problem is that I can't figure out how to loop through those variables.
I'm guessing that I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for o in request.POST.all

endfor
</code></pre>

<p>but then I'm really not sure what to do with that.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for someone to write the code for me, really: I just would like some guidance on how to write a loop like this in python / Django, and also maybe some pointers as to a good reference guide I can either see online or buy that will give me access to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also, the select object above I created pretty much by hand, and I'd really like to be able to ue a loop to generate it in the template in the first place. My template currently has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
{% for movie in movie_list %}
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; {{ movie }} &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;select name=""score{{ movie.id }}""&gt;
         &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;

       &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like there must be a way to create a simple loop that counts from 1 to 10 that would generate most of those options for me, but I can't figure out how to do that...</p>

1323,298779,11522.0,2008-11-18T13:55:17Z,3,Form (or Formset?) to handle multiple table rows in Django,"<p>I'm working on my first Django application. In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating (out of 10) to each film. I've been able to use the {{ form }} and {{ formset }} syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once? </p>

<p>At first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I can't see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Currently, my views.py has this code:</p>

<pre><code>def survey(request):
        ScoreFormSet = formset_factory(ScoreForm)
        if request.method == 'POST':
                formset = ScoreFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)
                if formset.is_valid():
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        else:
                formset = ScoreFormSet()
        return render_to_response('cf/survey.html', {
                'formset':formset,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>And my survey.html has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/survey/"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
{{ formset }}
&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;input type = ""submit"" value = ""Submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py are:</p>

<pre><code>class Score(models.Model):
        movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie)
        score = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)

class ScoreForm(ModelForm):
        class Meta:
                model = Score
</code></pre>

<p>So, in case the above is not clear, what I'm aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.</p>

<p>If anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, I'd be most grateful.</p>

So, I'm now thinking of going with PHP instead, as it's the method for creating dynamic web content I'm most familiar with, and I know I can get something working quickly.</p>

<p>My application, while simple, is probably going to be doing some reasonably complex AI stuff, and it may be that libraries don't exist for what I need in PHP. So I'm wondering how easy / possible it is for a PHP script to ""call"" a Java program or Python script or a program or script in another language. It's not entirely clear to me what exactly I mean by ""call"" in this context, but I guess I probably mean that ideally I'd like to define a function in, let's say Java, and then be able to call it from PHP. If that's not possible, then I guess my best bet (assuming I do go with PHP) will be to pass control directly to the external program explicitly through a POST or GET to a CGI program or similar.</p>

<p>Feel free to convince me I should stick with Django, although I'm really at the point where I just can't figure out what model I need to produce the HTML form I want, which seems such a basic thing that I fear for my chances of doing anything more complex...</p>

<p>Alternatively, anyone who can offer any advice on linking PHP and other languages, that'll be grateful received.</p>

<p>Okay. Take a deep breath. Here are the rules. Take <em>two</em> thirty sided dice (yes, <a href=""http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/k/koplow/dice/d30"" rel=""nofollow"">they do exist</a>) and roll them simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the two numbers</li>
<li>If both dice show &lt;= 5 or >= 26, throw again and <em>add</em> the result to what you have</li>
<li>If one is &lt;= 5 and the other >= 26, throw again and <em>subtract</em> the result from what 
you have</li>
<li>Repeat until either is > 5 and &lt; 26!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you write some code (see below), roll those dice a few million times and you count how often you receive each number as the final result, you get a curve that is pretty flat left of 1, around 45Â° degrees between 1 and 60 and flat above 60. The chance to roll 30.5 or better is greater than 50%, to roll better than 18 is 80% and to roll better than 0 is 97%.</p>

<p>Now the question: Is it possible to write a program to <em>calculate</em> the <em>exact</em> value f(x), i.e. the probability to roll a certain value?</p>

<p>Background: For our role playing game ""Jungle of Stars"" we looked for a way to keep random events in check. The rules above guarantee a much more stable outcome for something you try :)</p>

<p>Specifically, I <i>want to use</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The models and database abstraction</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/#the-low-level-cache-api"">caching API</a>, although I want to avoid database lookups by caching, not HTML generation, and since the caching framework in Django is intended for the latter, I'm not sure yet whether that's really appropriate.</li>

<p>I would <i>not use</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Templating</li>
<li>urlconfigs</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, more exactly, I'm neither using HTTP nor HTML. So basically, I have a different input / output chain than usual.</p>

<p>Can this work?</p>

<p>My personal killer feature in Django is the Object / database mapping that I can do with the models, so if there's another technology (doesn't have to be Python, I'm in the design phase and I'm pretty agnostic about languages and platforms) that gives me the same abilities, that would be great, too.</p>

Currently, I have a single extension module, ""rng"". I am using Python's Distutils to build and install the module. I can compile and install the module, but when I try to import the module using <code>import lehmer.rng</code> or <code>from lehmer import rng</code>, the Python interpreter throws an <code>ImportError</code> exception. I can import ""lehmer"" fine.</p>

<p>Here are the contents of my <code>setup.py</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup, Extension

<p>My <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable is set correctly, so that's not the problem (and as noted before, I can <code>import lehmer</code> just fine, so I <em>know</em> that <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is not the issue). Python uses the following search paths (as reported by <code>sys.path</code>):</p>

Am somewhat new to thinking in a non-relational manner and want to try avoiding any obvious pitfalls.  It's my understanding that a basic principal is that ""storage is cheap, don't worry about data duplication"" as you might in a normalized RDBMS.    </p>

<p>What I'd like to model is:</p>

<p>A blog article which can be given 0-n tags. Many blog articles can share the same tag.  When retrieving data would like to allow retrieval of all articles matching a tag.  In many ways very similar to the approach taken here at stackoverflow.</p>

<p>My normal mindset would be to create a many-to-may relationship between tags and blog articles.  However, I'm thinking in the context of GAE that this would be expensive, although I have seen examples of it being done. </p>

<p>Perhaps using a ListProperty containing each tag as part of the article entities, and a second data model to track tags as they're added and deleted?  This way no need for any relationships and the ListProperty still allows queries where any list element matching will return results.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on the most efficient way to approach this on GAE?</p>

1357,304655,39182.0,2008-11-20T08:40:40Z,4,The best way to invoke methods in Python class declarations?,"<p>Say I am declaring a class <code>C</code> and a few of the declarations are very similar. I'd like to use a function <code>f</code> to reduce code repetition for these declarations. It's possible to just declare and use <code>f</code> as usual:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     w = f(42)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.w
'&lt;42&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f(4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unbound method f() must be called with C instance as first argument (got int instance instead)
</code></pre>

<p>Oops! I've inadvertently exposed <code>f</code> to the outside world, but it doesn't take a <code>self</code> argument (and can't for obvious reasons). One possibility would be to <code>del</code> the function after I use it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     del f
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'f'
</code></pre>

<p>But what if I want to use <code>f</code> again later, after the declaration? It won't do to delete the function. I could make it ""private"" (i.e., prefix its name with <code>__</code>) and give it the <code>@staticmethod</code> treatment, but invoking <code>staticmethod</code> objects through abnormal channels gets very funky:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     @staticmethod
...     def __f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = __f.__get__(1)(9)   # argument to __get__ is ignored...
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I have to use the above craziness because <code>staticmethod</code> objects, which are descriptors, are not themselves callable. I need to recover the function wrapped by the <code>staticmethod</code> object before I can call it.</p>

<p>There has got to be a better way to do this. How can I cleanly declare a function in a class, use it during its declaration, and also use it later from within the class? Should I even be doing this?</p>

<p>The strange thing is that if I take out the signal_autoconnect(self) call, the window opens.  But if I replace that call with ""self.on_TestClass_destroy(self, None, None)"" instead, it returns the same NameError exception.</p>

<p>My understanding of the internals of the mp3 format is minimal. Ideally, I am looking for a library that would abstract those details away. I would prefer to use Python (but could be convinced otherwise).</p>

<p>I would like to modify a set of mp3 files in a fairly simple way. I am not so much interested in the ID3 tags but in the audio itself. I want to be able to delete sections (e.g. drop 10 seconds from the 3rd minute), and insert sections (e.g. add credits to the end.)</p>

<p>My understanding is that the mp3 format is lossy, and so decoding it to (for example) PCM format, making the modifications, and then encoding it again to MP3 will lower the audio quality. (I would love to hear that I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I <em>conjecture</em> that if I stay in mp3 format, there will be some sort of minimum frame or packet-size to deal with, so the granularity of the operations may be coarser. I can live with that, as long as I get an accuracy of within a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""http://pymedia.org/"">PyMedia</a>, but it requires me to migrate to PCM to process the data. Similarly, <a href=""http://lame.sourceforge.net"">LAME</a> wants to help me encode, but not access the data in place. I have seen several other libraries that only deal with the ID3 tags.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a Python MP3 library? Alternatively, can you disabuse me of my assumption that going to PCM and back is bad and avoidable?</p>

The program receives input from a GPS device, does calculations with the data, and uses the results of those calculations to control a series of motors designed to orientate a directional communication antenna, so the balloon, rocket or satellite always stays in focus.</p>

<p>Here is some further explanation of the data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I looks like I'll need five things
  out of every line. And bear in mind
  that any one of these area's may be
  empty. Meaning there will be just two
  commas right next to each other. Such

  may be but I don't think I should be

<p>In my Django code, I use the <code>@login_required</code> decorator from <code>django.contrib.auth.decorators</code> to mark which view requires authentication. The default behavior when a not authenticated user clicks it is to redirect him/her to login page, and then pass the target page. </p>

<p>What I saw on some sites, and really liked, is that when user clicks a link leading to a place restricted to logged-only users, instead of getting redirected to a login page, he/she gets a popup window (via JavaScript) asking him/her to log in or register.

<p>I have models to the tune of:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal(models.Model):
  pass

class Cat(Animal):
  def __unicode__(self):
    return ""This is a cat""

class Dog(Animal):

    return ""This is a dog""

class AnimalHome(models.Model):
  animal = models.ForeignKey(Animal)
</code></pre>

<p>I have instantiated no Animals, because this is supposed to be a virtual class.  I have instantiated Cats and Dogs, but in the Admin Page for AnimalHome, my choices for Animals are displayed as ""Animal object"" (the default __unicode__(), I guess) as opposed to the __unicode__ I have defined for the two subclasses.  Help.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>The abstract base class issue is a red herring wrt to this question, I think.  Even if Animal was not supposed to be abstract, I still have the problem that, for some reason, since the ForeignKey is defined on Animal and not one of its subclasses, the superclass method is being called instead of the subclass.  In OO programming when you call object.method() you're supposed to get the lowest-subclass's implementation, and you have to do extra work to get any superclass's implementation.  So why is it that having __unicode__ defined on the subclasses is not sufficient for --- actually the problem might be that __unicode__ is not getting called at all because introspection on the Animal class reveals that it's not defined.  So maybe if I define __unicode__ for Animal and have it call subclasses' __unicode__ I could get the desired effect.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay, I think that I understand the ORM issues.  Both these answers have helped me understand this, thank you.  While experimenting with this, I discovered that when Django saves a subclassed model, it does two things: (1) it creates a row for the subclassed object in the superclass's table, and (2) it makes the PK in the subclass table identical to the PK assigned in the superclass table.  This PK in the subclass table is named superclass_ptr.  Based upon this I've concocted the following.  I'd appreciate feedback.</p>

<pre><code>Class Animal(models.Model)
  def __unicode__(self):
    if Dog.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Dog.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    elif Cat.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Cat.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    else:
      return ""An Animal!""
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>It seems that Lawrence is most on-point wrt this question.  Cat and Dog will have disjoint PK sets (and any subclass of Animal will have a PK identical to the record of its superclass), but unfortunately Django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la: ""I'm an Animal.  I know Animals have subclasses Dog and Cat.  Specifically, I'm Animal number 3, and furthermore I just checked and there's a Cat number 3 too.  That means that I'm actually Cat number 3"".  Even though this seems entirely possible and very reasonable (since a Cat won't do anything an Animal couldn't do itself) using Python's introspection.  Thank you all.</p>

<p>I'm building a fair-sized web application with a friend in my own time, and we've decided to go with the Django framework on Python. Django provides us with a lot of features we're going to need, so please don't suggest alternative frameworks.</p>

<p>The only decision I'm having trouble with, is whether we use Python or Jython to develop our application. Now I'm pretty familiar with Java and could possibly benefit from the libraries within the JDK. I know minimal Python, but am using this project as an opportunity to learn a new language - so the majority of work will be written in Python.</p>

<p>The attractiveness of Jython is of course the JVM. The number of python/django enabled web-hosts is extremely minimal - whereas I'm assuming I could drop a jython/django application on a huge variety of hosts. This isn't a massive design decision, but still one I think needs to be decided. I'd really prefer jython over python for the jvm accessibility alone.</p>

<p><b> Questions </b>  </p>

<p>Does Jython have many limitations compared to regular python? Will running django on jython cause problems? How quick is the Jython team to release updates alongside Python? Will Django work as advertised on Jython (with very minimal pre-configuration)?</p>

<p><b> Decision </b></p>

<p>Thanks for the helpful comments. What I think I'm going to do is develop in Jython for the JVM support - but to try to only use Python code/libraries. Portability isn't a major concern so if I need a library in the JDK (not readily available in python), I'll use it. As long as Django is fully supported, I'm happy.</p>

<p>When the user selects multiple entries from the list control (pressing CTRL or shift while clicking), the ObjectiveListView module gives me a list of dictionaries, the dictionaries containing the data in the rows of the list control. This is exactly what I want, good!</p>

<p>The returned list looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>print MyList
[{'id':1023, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'23.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}, {'id':1024, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'24.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}, {'id':23, 'type':'Purchase', 'date':'2.8.2008', 'sum':'-21,90', 'target':'Apple Store'}]

<p>I don't know how to properly compare the dicts in the list. One big problem is that I don't know beforehand how many dicts the list contains, since it's decided by the user.</p>

<p>I have a vague idea that list comprehensions would be the way to go, but I only know how to compare two lists with list comprehensions, not n lists. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

The first and second items will be one row in the results, the third and fourth would be the next line in the results (after someone decides what the uniform column header label should be)</p>

<p>I tested pickle and was able to save and retrieve my data.  However, I need to be able to preserve the order in the output.  One idea I have is to add another key that would be a counter so I could retrieve my data and then sort by the counter.  Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I don't want to put this into a database because it is not permanent.  </p>

<p>I have a situation where emails come in with different attachments. Certain file types I process others I ignore and dont write to file.
I am caught in a rather nasty situation, because sometimes people send an email as an attachment, and that attached email has legal attachments. </p>

<p>What I want to do is skip that attached email and all its attachments.</p>

<p>using python/jythons std email lib how can i do this?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>to make it clearer</p>

<p>I need to parse an email (named ROOT email), I want to get the attachments from this email using jython.
Next certain attachments are supported ie .pdf .doc etc
now it just so happens that, the clients send an email (ROOT email) with another email message (CHILD email) as an attachment, and in CHILD email it has .pdf attachments and such like.</p>

<p>What I need is: to get rid of any CHILD emails attached to the ROOT email AND the CHILD emails attachments. What happens is I walk over the whole email and it just parses every attachment, BOTH ROOT attachments and CHILD attachments as if they were ROOT attachments.</p>

<p>I cannot have this. I am only interested in ROOT attachements that are legal ie .pdf .doc. xls .rtf .tif .tiff</p>

<p>That should do for now, I have to run to catch a bus!
thanks!</p>

<p>I'm trying to bundle the library and plugins into a Puppet-installable RPM. The actual RPM-building should be straightforward; once I have a <code>distutils</code>-produced distfile I can make it into an RPM based on a .spec file pinched from the Dag or EPEL repos [1]. It's the <code>distutils</code> bit I'm unsure of -- in fact I'm not even sure my library is correctly written for packaging. Here's how it works:</p>

<p>idol7stats.py:</p>

import stat
import sys
import time
import urllib

class IDOL7Stats:
  cache_dir = '/tmp'

  def __init__(self, host, port):
    self.host = host
    self.port = port

  # ...

  def collect(self):
    self.data = self.__parseXML(self.__getXML())

  def total_slots(self):
    return self.data['Service:Documents:TotalSlots']
</code></pre>

<p>Plugin code:</p>

<pre><code>from idol7stats import IDOL7Stats
a = IDOL7Stats('db.example.com', 23113)
a.collect()
print a.total_slots()
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I want idol7stats.py to wind up in <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/idol7stats</code>, or something else in Python's search path. What <code>distutils</code> magic do I need? This:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup

setup(name = 'idol7stats',
  author = 'Me',
  author_email = 'me@example.com',
  version = '0.1',
  py_modules = ['idol7stats'])
</code></pre>

<p>almost works, except the code goes in <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/idol7stats.py</code>, not a subdirectory. I expect this is down to my not understanding the difference between modules/packages/other containers in Python.</p>

<p>So, what's the rub?</p>

<p>[1] Yeah, I could just plonk the library in <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages</code> using RPM but I want to know how to package Python code.</p>

<p>My language of choice is PHP, I consider myself quite proficient and I can really dig in deep and come out with a solution.  This project, I feel, can be used as a good exercise to learn another language. The big 2 that come to mind are Python and Ruby on Rails as everyone talks about them like its the next coming of our savior. Since this is mostly just an API and has no admin or public facing anything, seems like basic Python running a simple http server seems like the way to go. Am I missing anything?

  is better?</p>

  <p>pow and ** are equivalent; math.sqrt doesn't work for complex numbers,

1484,327223,121.0,2008-11-29T05:33:26Z,32,Memory Efficient Alternatives to Python Dictionaries,"<p>In one of my current side projects, I am scanning through some text looking at the frequency of word triplets.  In my first go at it, I used the default dictionary three levels deep.  In other words, topDictionary[word1][word2][word3] returns the number of times these words appear in the text, topdictionary[word1][word2] returns a dictionary with all the words that appeared following words 1 and 2, etc.</p>

<p>This functions correctly, but it is very memory intensive.  In my initial tests it used something like 20 times the memory of just storing the triplets in a text file, which seems like an overly large amount of memory overhead.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that many of these dictionaries are being created with many more slots than are actually being used, so I want to replace the dictionaries with something else that is more memory efficient when used in this manner.  I would strongly prefer a solution that allows key lookups along the lines of the dictionaries.</p>

<p>From what I know of data structures, a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or AVL would probably be ideal, but I would really prefer not to implement them myself.  If possible, I'd prefer to stick with standard python libraries, but I'm definitely open to other alternatives if they would work best.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  A few of the answers so far have suggested using tuples, which didn't really do much for me when I condensed the first two words into a tuple.  I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (ie I want something like the result of topDict[word1,word2].keys() ).  </p>

<p>The current dataset I am playing around with is the most recent version of <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/wikipedia-for-schools.htm"">Wikipedia For Schools</a>.  The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.  I know that there will be some additional overhead for pointers and whatnot, but the difference seems excessive.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you all for the responses so far.</p>

<p>My plan was to use a dictionary, where the value of t is the key for the dictionary, and the value against the key would be a list. I could then append each (x,y) to the list. Something like:</p>

<pre><code># where t = 0, c = (4,7), d = {}

I think I will have to check the dictionary on each loop through the input to see if the dictionary key already exists, I guess by using something like max(d.keys()): if it is there, append data, if not create the empty list as the dictionary value, and then append data on the next loop through. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Apologies if the question above was too unclear or general.  What I'm asking for is if folks have had experience doing a similar modest website, what would be recommendations for tools, frameworks, or techniques outside of those I listed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there another Python CMS that I should consider besides the two I listed?  E.g. there may be a great Python solution, but it isn't built on top of Django.</li>
<li>Perhaps all current Python CMS packages are too ""alpha,"" and I'd be better off writing my own from scratch?  Although I am up to it, I'd rather leverage an existing package.</li>
<li>Given this kind of project, would you deploy a CMS with built-in (or plug-in) support for blogs, forums, etc. or would you rather design a simpler website and embed the more complex content management using other services, relying on your own website only as a dumb proxy or portal.  E.g. one can re-publish Blogger.com content using the Google Gdata API.  One can embed re-branded Nabble.com archives into any website, which may provide forum/mailinglist functionality more easily than running the forum itself.</li>
<li>Sometimes a CMS package has its own CSS integrated, and using another CSS framework would be redundant or otherwise make no sense.  Yes?  No?</li>
<li>Are there plugins for Django in Eclipse or Netbeans?  I understand there's a pretty nice environment for Rails development in NetBeans, and I've read some people wish longingly for something similar for Django, but I don't know if these wishes have since been realized.</li>
<li>What are some current preferred tools for unit and functional testing a Django application?  Are these integrated with Eclipse or Netbeans?</li>

1509,329956,19207.0,2008-12-01T03:31:45Z,9,Python crypt module -- what's the correct use of salts?,"<p>First, context: I'm trying to create a command-line-based tool (Linux) that
requires login. Accounts on this tool have nothing to do with
system-level accounts -- none of this looks at /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>I am planning to store user accounts in a text file using the same format (roughly) as /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>Despite not using the system-level password files, using crypt seemed
to be a good practice to use, as opposed to storing passwords in
cleartext. (While crypt is certainly better than storing passwords in
cleartext, I'm open to other ways of doing this.)</p>

<p>My crypt knowledge is based on this:
<a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/crypt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/crypt.html</a></p>

<p>The documentation seems to ask for something that isn't possible: ""it
is recommended to use the full crypted password as salt when checking
for a password.""</p>

<p>Huh? If I'm creating the crypted password (as in, when creating a user
record) how can I use the crypted password as a salt? It
doesn't exist yet. (I'm assuming that you must use the same salt for creating and checking a password.)</p>

<p>I've tried using the plaintext password as a salt. This does
work, but has two problems; one easily overcome, and one serious:</p>

<p>1) The first two letters of the plaintext password are included in the
crypted password. You can fix this by not writing the first two
characters to the file:</p>

<pre><code>user_record = '%s:%s:%s' % (user_name, crypted_pw[2:], user_type)
</code></pre>

<p>2) By using the plaintext password as the salt, you would seem to be
reducing the amount of entropy in the system. Possibly I'm
misunderstanding the purpose of the salt.</p>

<p>The best practice I've been able to derive is to use the first two
characters from the username as the salt. Would this be appropriate,
or is there something I've missed that makes that a bad move?</p>

<p>My understanding of a salt is that it prevents pre-computing password
hashes from a dictionary. I could use a standard salt for all
passwords (such as my initials, ""JS,"") but that seems to be less of a
burden for an attacker than using two characters from each user's username.</p>

1512,330367,40076.0,2008-12-01T09:26:07Z,6,How would one make Python objects persistent in a web-app?,"<p>I'm writing a reasonably complex web application. The Python backend runs an algorithm whose state depends on data stored in several interrelated database tables which does not change often, plus user specific data which does change often. The algorithm's per-user state undergoes many small changes as a user works with the application. This algorithm is used often during each user's work to make certain important decisions.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, re-initializing the state on every request from the (semi-normalized) database data quickly becomes non-feasible. It would be highly preferable, for example, to cache the state's Python object in some way so that it can simply be used and/or updated whenever necessary. However, since this is a web application, there several processes serving requests, so using a global variable is out of the question.</p>

<p>I've tried serializing the relevant object (via pickle) and saving the serialized data to the DB, and am now experimenting with caching the serialized data via memcached. However, this still has the significant overhead of serializing and deserializing the object often.</p>

<p>I've looked at shared memory solutions but the only relevant thing I've found is <a href=""http://poshmodule.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">POSH</a>. However POSH doesn't seem to be widely used and I don't feel easy integrating such an experimental component into my application.</p>

<p>I need some advice! This is my first shot at developing a web application, so I'm hoping this is a common enough issue that there are well-known solutions to such problems. At this point solutions which assume the Python back-end is running on a single server would be sufficient, but extra points for solutions which scale to multiple servers as well :)</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have this application working, currently live and with active users. I started out without doing any premature optimization, and then optimized as needed. I've done the measuring and testing to make sure the above mentioned issue is the actual bottleneck. I'm sure pretty sure I could squeeze more performance out of the current setup, but I wanted to ask if there's a better way.</li>
<li>The setup itself is still a work in progress; assume that the system's architecture can be whatever suites your solution.</li>

Currently, I'm storing all the windows in one monolithic glade file.  When I run a window I call it like...</p>

<pre><code>self.wTree = gtk.glade.XML(""interface.glade"", ""WindowXYZ"")
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder if it would be a better idea to split each window into it's own glade file.  Instead of one glade file with 25 windows/dialogs I'd have 25 glade files with one window/dialog each and call it like so:</p>

<pre><code>self.wTree = gtk.glade.XML(""windowxyz.glade"")
</code></pre>

<p>What do you guys think is the best way to do this?  Is one method more resource intensive than another?  One thing that would be nice about going to individual glade files is that naming widgets would be easier.  For example, I name all my OK buttons ""windowxyz_ok"", but I could change it to simply ""ok"" instead.  Makes things simpler.  The downside is that it may be a bit less convenient to make changes to different windows.</p>

<p>I'm open to any and all arguments.  Thanks!</p>

<p>What I have:</p>

<p>Form 1: 10 yes/no questions (each yes corresponds to a new form that needs to be filled out)<br />
if yes is ticked, the corresponding forms are put into a formwizard and displayed for the user to complete. </p>

So the frontend is a HTML page which communicates with the program via AJAX. Can you give me a minimal implementation for the server-side using the python <code>SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler</code>?</p>

<p>A simple example would be a textfield and a button. When the button is pressed the content of the field is send to the server which then sends back a corresponding answer. I am aware that there are many powerful solutions for this in Python, but I would like to keep this very simple.
I already found some nice examples for such a server (e.g. <a href=""http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/julien/04Ajax"">here</a>), but so far I could not come up with a truly minimal one.</p>

<p>In case you wonder why I want to implement the GUI in such a way: My focus for this application is to display lots of data in a nice layout with only minimal interaction - so using HTML+CSS seems most convenient (and I have been already using it for non-interactive data display).</p>

In cases of huge result sets this becomes unusable. I would like instead to actually retrieve the rows one by one from the server.</p>

<p>In Java, following the instructions <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-j-reference-implementation-notes.html"">here</a> (under ""ResultSet""), I create a statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>stmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
</code></pre>

<p>This works nicely in Java. My question is: is there a way to do the same in python?</p>

<p>One thing I tried is to limit the query to a 1000 rows at a time, like this:</p>

<pre><code>start_row = 0
while True:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(""SELECT item FROM items LIMIT %d,1000"" % start_row)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    if not rows:
        break
    start_row += 1000
    # Do something with rows...
</code></pre>

<p>However, this seems to get slower the higher start_row is.</p>

<p>And no, using <code>fetchone()</code> instead of <code>fetchall()</code> doesn't change anything.</p>

<h2>Clarification:</h2>

<p>The naive code I use to reproduce this problem looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import MySQLdb

conn = MySQLdb.connect(user=""user"", passwd=""password"", db=""mydb"")
cur = conn.cursor()
print ""Executing query""
cur.execute(""SELECT * FROM bigtable"");

print ""Starting loop""
row = cur.fetchone()
while row is not None:
    print "", "".join([str(c) for c in row])
    row = cur.fetchone()

cur.close()
conn.close()
</code></pre>

<p>On a ~700,000 rows table, this code runs quickly. But on a ~9,000,000 rows table it prints ""Executing Query"" and then hangs for a long long time. That is why it makes no difference if I use <code>fetchone()</code> or <code>fetchall()</code>.</p>

<p>In Flash, we have a shared library between our Flash apps - package xyz. We can make changes to the package without fear of breaking other apps when they are deployed because Flash compiles their code and includes the contents of the library. We deploy the final SWF via RPM, and we're done. Updates to App1 and App2 won't ever break App3.</p>

<p>How would you approach this in Python, the shared library dependency. </p>

<p>App1, App2 and App3, could all require xyz-lib.rpm, and all use the same library files, but an updated xyz-lib.rpm would have to be explicitly tested against App1,2,3 <em>every time</em> there was a new library, and this is just onerous.</p>

<p>My current favorite solution - I could make app1.rpm include the library from when it was packaged - effectively some sort of static linking of the library. This, however, feels inelegant. (although the only additional cost is hard drive space == cheap.)</p>

<p>I know that solid management of the shared library is probably the best solution, but I keep trying to factor in that all the developers are human, and will make mistakes. We're going to make mistakes, and I don't want a deployment of app1 to break app2 and app3 - it's just a lot more to test and debug for.</p>

1566,342434,33775.0,2008-12-04T23:24:26Z,39,Python logging in Django,"<p>I'm developing a Django app, and I'm trying to use Python's logging module for error/trace logging.  Ideally I'd like to have different loggers configured for different areas of the site.  So far I've got all of this working, but one thing has me scratching my head.</p>

<p>I have the root logger going to sys.stderr, and I have configured another logger to write to a file.  This is in my settings.py file:</p>

<pre><code>sviewlog = logging.getLogger('MyApp.views.scans')
view_log_handler = logging.FileHandler('C:\\MyApp\\logs\\scan_log.log')
view_log_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
view_log_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'))
sviewlog.addHandler(view_log_handler)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems pretty simple.  Here's the problem, though: whatever I write to the sviewlog gets written to the log file twice.  The root logger only prints it once.  It's like addHandler() is being called twice.  And when I put my code through a debugger, this is exactly what I see.  The code in settings.py is getting executed twice, so two FileHandlers are created and added to the same logger instance.  But why?  And how do I get around this?</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what's going on here?  I've tried moving the sviewlog logger/handler instantiation code to the file where it's used (since that actually seems like the appropriate place to me), but I have the same problem there.  Most of the examples I've seen online use only the root logger, and I'd prefer to have multiple loggers.</p>

I am creating several processes each with its own multiprocessor.JoinableQueue instance.  Each process spawns one or more worker threads (subclasses of threading.Thread) which share the JoinableQueue instance (passed in through each Thread's <code>__init__</code> method).  It seems to generally work but occasionally and unpredictably fails with the following error:</p>

<p>Any ideas what is going on?  Can I use a multiprocessor Queue with threads instead of the more traditional (Queue.Queue)?</p>

I'm currently using SVN, with only one workspace, so I just have the workspace on my PYTHONPATH. I'm realizing this is less than ideal, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest a more 'proper' way of doing this.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate with a hypothetical situation:
I say I have a module 'eggs', with sub-modules 'foo' and 'bar'. Components in 'bar' use code in foo, so eggs/bar/a.py may 'import eggs.foo'. </p>

<p>Say that 'eggs' is in a git repository. I want to try out some changes to 'foo', so I copy it. The problem is that 'import eggs.foo' in eggs/bar finds the original repository in the PYTHONPATH, so it ends up using the old 'foo' instead of my modified one. </p>

<p>How do I set myself up such that each copy of the module uses its own associated 'foo'? Thanks.</p>

<p>edit- Thanks for the pointer to relative imports. I've read up on it and I can see how to apply it. One problem I'd have with using it is that I've built up a fairly large codebase, and I haven't been too neat about it so most modules have a  quick 'self-test' under <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code>, which from what I've read does not play with relative imports: </p>

</ul>

<p>The other solution I've been able to google up is to deliberately manipulate sys.path, which seems like an even worse hack. Are there any other possibilities?</p>

<p>edit - Thanks for the suggestions. I'd originally misunderstood git branches, so as pointed out branches are exactly what I want. Nonetheless, I hadn't heard of relative imports before so thanks for that as well. I've learnt something new and may incorporate its use.</p>

<li>It allows me to serve (mostly) static pages with minimal URL configuration.</li>
<li>I don't have to write views for each of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I don't need the model <code>FlatPage</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>I leave the content empty and just supply a template path. Therefore I can take advantage of having the source in a file;
<ul>
<li>I can edit the source directly from the file system, without the help of a server (such as admin).</li>
<li>I can take advantage of syntax highlightning and other editor features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With the model I have to maintain fixtures for flatpages.
<ul>
<li>So the data for the same entity is in two seperate places.</li>
<li>If I move the content inside the fixture it'll be more difficult to edit.
<ul>
<li>Even if fixture maintenance was a non-issue I'd still need to dump and load these fixtures again and again during development.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Basically; getting rid of <code>FlatPage</code> model while maintaining <code>contrib.flatpages</code> functionality. I don't have a clear idea how this should be solved. If there's a clean way of modifying (like <code>add_to_class</code>) <code>FlatPages</code> to get the information somewhere other than the database I'd prefer that. Maybe the metadata can be inserted to the templates and then a special manager that reads this data would replace the default manager of <code>FlatPages</code>.</p>

<p>If I don't prefer manual editing over admin functionality for flatpages, how can take the database out of the equation?</p>

1594,347010,,2008-12-06T23:58:08Z,4,Questions for python->scheme conversion,"<p>I currently am trying to write a Python program using scheme semantics so I can later translate it into Scheme without relying on a lot of Pythonic stuff.</p>

<p>I'm trying solve the sliding puzzle problem (where you have 9 slots and 8 tiles arranged in a square) using a*, depth first, and breadth first search algorithm.  I did this ~11 years ago in some AI class in Lisp, but basically at the time I had no idea about lisp, I hated it with all my heart, and only in retrospect do I realize I was programming ""C"" in Lisp.  The prof didn't help in this matter.</p>

<p>I have a python function which can swap two tiles easily:  </p>

<pre><code>def swap(p, (r1, c1), (r2, c2)):  
    # Swaps *any* two locations and returns new configuration  
    # Does not concern itself with zero location, etc  
    # Not sure how to do this functionally  
    p_p = p[:]  
    temp = p_p[r1][c1]  
    p_p[r1][c1] = p_p[r2][c2]  
    p_p[r2][c2] = temp  
    return p_p  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to turn this into something you might find in SICP, avoiding side effects, etc.  </p>

<p>But this brings up a question.  Everything I read in SICP is loops via recursion.  I didn't see anything in accessing arrays/vectors/lists in constant time.  I can imagine a loopish/recursive way to read an element, but I find it harder to imagine a way to create a new list with a certain element changed, without invoking side-effect producing things like set!, and without resorting to crazy if/then/else clauses concerning which element should be changed.  This of course gets more confusing when considering a 2d array.  In this case the solution with python is obvious because of its native support for multidimensional arrays.</p>

<p>In C/C++/Python/Matlab/Lua/anything else, accessing lists/arrays via the [i] syntax is easy, and directly translates to a hardware-oriented pointer lookup somewhere underneath.  I don't understand how scheme does this, given the atomic operations defined in the SICP version of scheme, which all seem very loop-and-search oriented.  How do the vector and list array access functions work to get constant time access?  (I'm a total newbie here, so I'm not ever sure what functions I'd be talking about).  Is there a C or Assembly library someplace which is secretly being accessed?  Are there any inherent constant-time semantics in scheme which could be used for list/array/vector access, and which would allow me a guilt-free way of using that idiom in Python for the moment?  </p>

<p>How would can I rewrite the above function in python using Schemish semantics?  How would I rewrite the above function in Scheme?</p>

1596,347109,37984.0,2008-12-07T01:59:49Z,14,How do I concisely implement multiple similar unit tests in the Python unittest framework?,"<p>I'm implementing unit tests for a family of functions that all share a number of invariants. For example, calling the function with two matrices produce a matrix of known shape.</p>

<p>I would like to write unit tests to test the entire family of functions for this property, without having to write an individual test case for each function (particularly since more functions might be added later). </p>

<p>One way to do this would be to iterate over a list of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
import numpy

from somewhere import the_functions
from somewhere.else import TheClass

class Test_the_functions(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.matrix1 = numpy.ones((5,10))
    self.matrix2 = numpy.identity(5)

  def testOutputShape(unittest.TestCase):
     """"""Output of functions be of a certain shape""""""
     for function in all_functions:
       output = function(self.matrix1, self.matrix2)
       fail_message = ""%s produces output of the wrong shape"" % str(function)
       self.assertEqual(self.matrix1.shape, output.shape, fail_message)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>I got the idea for this from <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/unit_testing/romantest.html"">Dive Into Python</a>. There, it's not a list of functions being tested but a list of known input-output pairs. The problem with this approach is that if any element of the list fails the test, the later elements don't get tested.</p>

<p>I looked at subclassing unittest.TestCase and somehow providing the specific function to test as an argument, but as far as I can tell that prevents us from using unittest.main() because there would be no way to pass the argument to the testcase.</p>

<p>I also looked at dynamically attaching ""testSomething"" functions to the testcase, by using setattr with a lamdba, but the testcase did not recognize them.</p>

<p>How can I rewrite this so it remains trivial to expand the list of tests, while still ensuring every test is run?</p>

1598,347497,745.0,2008-12-07T11:41:34Z,3,Emitting headers from a tiny Python web-framework,"<p>I am writing a web-framework for Python, of which the goal is to be as ""small"" as possible (currently under 100 lines of code).. You can see the current code <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/pyerweb/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">on github</a></p>

<p>Basically it's written to be as simple to use as possible. An example ""Hello World"" like site:</p>

<pre><code>from pyerweb import GET, runner

@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return ""&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; would be the output HTML for the URL / ""

@GET(""/view/([0-9]+?)$"")
def view_something(id):
    return ""Viewing id %s"" % (id) # URL /view/123 would output ""Viewing id 123""

runner(url = ""/"", # url would be from a web server, in actual use
       output_helper = ""html_tidy"" # run returned HTML though ""HTML tidy""
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you have a function that returns HTML, and the GET decorator maps this to a URL.</p>

<p>When <code>runner()</code> is called, each decorated function is checked, if the URL regex matches the request URL, the function is run, and the output is sent to the browser.</p>

<p>Now, the problem - outputting headers. Currently for development I've just put a line before the <code>runner()</code> call which does <code>print Content-type:text/html\n</code> - this is obviously a bit limiting..</p>

<p>My first ideas was to have the functions return a dict, something like..</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return {
        ""html"": ""&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"",
        ""headers"": {""Location"":""http://google.com""}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like this - having to return a dict with a specifically named key isn't nearly as nice as just returning a string..</p>

<p>I could check if the returned data is a dict, if so use <code>returned_data['html']</code> as the output, if it's a string, there is no custom headers to be sent... but this means to go from no headers (which would be the case a huge majority of the time) to headers, you'd have to change the return function from <code>return my_html</code> to <code>return {'html':my_html}</code> which isn't very elegant either..</p>

<p>After writing this, I discovered ""Sinatra"" - a similar-in-use Ruby library, and looked at how it dealt with headers:</p>

<pre><code>get ""/"" do
    content_type 'text/css', :charset =&gt; 'utf-8'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like it could be nice enough in Python:</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    header(""location"", ""http://google.com"")
</code></pre>

<p>To implement this, I was considering changing how the functions are executed - instead of simply using the return value, I would change <code>sys.stdout</code> to a StringIO, so you could do..</p>

<pre><code>def index():
    print ""&lt;html&gt;""
    print ""&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Something&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;""
    print ""&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;""
    print ""&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>..without having to worry about concatenating a bunch of strings together. The upshot of this is I could have a separate stream for headers, so the above <code>header()</code> function would write to this.. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def header(name, value):
    pyerweb.header_stream.write(""%s: %s"" % (name, value))
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the question is, how would you output headers from this web-framework (mostly in terms of <em>use</em>, but to a lesser extent implementation)?</p>

1606,348196,,2008-12-07T22:15:46Z,42,Creating a list of objects in Python,"<p>I'm trying to create a Python script that opens several databases and compares their contents.  In the process of creating that script, I've run into a problem in creating a list whose contents are objects that I've created.</p>

<p>I've simplified the program to its bare bones for this posting. First I create a new class, create a new instance of it, assign it an attribute and then write it to a list.  Then I assign a new value to the instance and again write it to a list... and again and again...</p>

<p>Problem is, it's always the same object so I'm really just changing the base object.  When I read the list, I get a repeat of the same object over and over.  </p>

<p>So how do you write objects to a list within a loop?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Bob J</p>

<p>Here's my simplified code</p>

<pre><code>class SimpleClass(object):
    pass

x = SimpleClass
# Then create an empty list
simpleList = []
#Then loop through from 0 to 3 adding an attribute to the instance 'x' of SimpleClass
for count in range(0,4):       
    # each iteration creates a slightly different attribute value, and then prints it to
# prove that step is working
# but the problem is, I'm always updating a reference to 'x' and what I want to add to
# simplelist is a new instance of x that contains the updated attribute

x.attr1= '*Bob* '* count
print ""Loop Count: %s Attribute Value %s"" % (count, x.attr1)
simpleList.append(x)

print '-'*20
# And here I print out each instance of the object stored in the list 'simpleList'
# and the problem surfaces.  Every element of 'simpleList' contains the same      attribute value

y = SimpleClass
print ""Reading the attributes from the objects in the list""
for count in range(0,4):
    y = simpleList[count]
    print y.attr1
</code></pre>

<p>So how do I (append, extend, copy or whatever) the elements of simpleList so that each entry contains a different instance of the object instead of all pointing to the same one?</p>

<p>n is usually no greater than 10 and the list usually has around 20000 elements. The list is always different each time I call the function. Sorting can't be made in place.</p>

<p>Initially, I have written this function:</p>

<pre><code>def mins(items, n):
    mins = [float('inf')]*n
    for item in items:
        for i, min in enumerate(mins):
	        if item &lt; min:
		        mins.insert(i, item)
		        mins.pop()
		        break
    return mins

<p>But this function can't beat a simple sorted(items)[:n] which sort the entire list. Here is my test:</p>

<pre><code>from random import randint, random
import time

test_data = [randint(10, 50) + random() for i in range(20000)]

init = time.time()
mins = mins(test_data, 8)
print 'mins(items, n):', time.time() - init

init = time.time()
mins = sorted(test_data)[:8]
print 'sorted(items)[:n]:', time.time() - init

<pre><code>mins(items, n): 0.0632939338684
sorted(items)[:n]: 0.0231449604034

<p>sorted()[:n] is three times faster. I believe this is because:</p>

<ol>
<li>insert() operation is costly because Python lists are not linked lists.</li>
<li>sorted() is an optimized c function and mine is pure python.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any way to beat sorted()[:n] ?

  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)
  result.append(x2)

However, I'm still unclear how apps inside a site interact with one another.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I'm writing a blog application (a rather popular activity, apparently). Blog posts and comments tend to go together, and yet they are distinct enough that they should be built into separate apps, as is the general philosophy of Djano development.</p>

<p>Consider the following example. In reality I would not actually write the comment app myself, as good code for that already exists on the web, but this is for demonstration/practice purposes:</p>

<p><strong>mysite/blog/models.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>mysite/comments/models.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models
from mysite.blog.models import post

class comment(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField()
    post = models.ForeignKey(post)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()
</code></pre>

<p>Is what I wrote above, importing a model from another app and setting it as a foreign key, how Django apps interact? Or is there a different/better method for the apps that comprise a site to interact?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
Per the recommendation in one response, I'm reading the documentation for contrib.contenttypes. If I'm reading this correctly, I could rewrite my example comment app like this:  </p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models  
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.contrib.contentypes import generic

class comment(models.Model):  
    id = models.AutoField()  
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
    text = models.TextField()  
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)  
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey(content_type, id)  
</code></pre>

<p>Would this be correct?</p>

<p>I'm not interested in adovacy arguments. Please do not tell why something <em>should</em> be more productive of something else. I'm interested in studies that measures that the use of something is related or not related to the productivity.</p>

<p>I'm interested in statisticals evidences. If you claim that the productivity depends from many other factors then there should be a statistical study that proves that the language choiche is not statistically correlated to the productivity.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. </p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, </p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>

<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"">mutable</a>, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/"">implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces</a>, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning. </p>

<p>So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?</p>

<p>for your reference:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmrNH.jpg"" alt=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmrNH.jpg""></p>

<p>database entries 1,2 and 3 are made using jython 2.2.1 using jdbc1.2.
database entry 4 is made using vb the old to be replace program using odbc.</p>

<p>We have found that if I copy and paste both jython and vb MailBody entries to wordpad directly from that SQL Server Enterprise Manager software it outputs the format perfectly with correct line returns. if I compare the bytes of each file with a hex editor or KDiff3 they are binary identically the same.</p>

<p>There is a 3rd party program which consumes this data. Sadly that 3rd party program reads the data and for entries 1 to 3 it displays the data without line returns. though for entry 4 it correctly formats the text. As futher proof we can see in the picture, the data in the database is displayed differently.
Somehow the line returns are preserved in the database for the vb entries but the jython entries they are overlooked. if I click on the 'MailBody' field of entry 4 i can press down i can see the rest of the email. Whereas the data for jython is displayed in one row.</p>

<p>What gives, what am i missing, and how do I handle this?
Here is a snippet of the code where I actually send it to the database.</p>

<p>EDIT: FYI: please disregard the discrepancies in the 'Processed' column, it is irrelevant.
EDIT: what i want to do is make the jython program input the data in the same way as the vb program. So that the 3rd party program will come along and correctly display the data.
so what it will look like is every entry in 'MailBody' will display ""This is a testing only!"" then next line ""etc etc"" so if I was to do a screendump all entries would resemble database entry 4.</p>

<p>If not, what would be the best way to handle such situations?</p>

<p>For an example I made up a color class. <em>This class should only work as a basic example to discuss this</em>, there is lot's of unnecessary and/or redundant stuff in there.</p>

<p>It would be nice, if I could call the constructor with different objects (a list, an other color object or three integers...) and the constructor handles them accordingly. In this basic example it works in some cases with * args and * * kwargs, but using class methods is the only general way I came up with. What would be a ""<strong>best practice</strong>"" like solution for this?</p>

<p>The constructor aside, if I would like to implement an _ _ <strong>add</strong> _ _ method too, how can I get this method to accept all of this: A plain integer (which is added to all values), three integers (where the first is added to the red value and so forth) or another color object (where both red values are added together, etc.)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I added an <em>alternative</em> constructor (initializer, _ _ <strong>init</strong> _ _) that basicly does all the stuff I wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>But I stick with the first one and the factory methods. Seems clearer.</p></li>
<li><p>I also added an _ _ <strong>add</strong> _ _, which does all the things mentioned above but I'm not sure if it's <em>good style</em>. I try to use the iteration protocol and fall back to ""single value mode"" instead of checking for specific types. Maybe still ugly tho.</p></li>
<li><p>I have taken a look at _ _ <strong>new</strong> _ _, thanks for the links.</p></li>
<li><p>My first quick try with it fails: I filter the rgb values from the * args and * * kwargs (is it a class, a list, etc.) then call the superclass's _ _ new _ _ with the right args (just r,g,b) to pass it along to init. The call to the 'Super(cls, self)._ _ new _ _ (....)' works, but since I generate and return the same object as the one I call from (as intended), all the original args get passed to _ _ init _ _ (working as intended), so it bails. </p></li>
<li><p>I could get rid of the _ _ init _ _ completly and set the values in the _ _ new _ _ but I don't know... feels like I'm abusing stuff here ;-) I should take a good look at metaclasses and new first I guess.</p></li>

<p>I have basically this:</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
</code></pre>

<p>and then I want to spawn another process, I don't care about this one anymore, whether it ended or not.</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command2')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
</code></pre>

<p>And the code is hanging at the second ""spawn""</p>

<p>However, if I comment out the first call, the second one works, so i'm guessing that the fact that the first one is still running or something is keeping it from working.</p>

<p>Now, the other thing I haven't been able to do is wait until the first one stops.
I've tried:<br />
child.close() - it hangs (both with True and False as parameters)
child.read(-1) - it hangs<br />
child.expect(pexpect.EOF) - it hangs.<br />
child.terminate() - it hangs  (both with True and False as parameters)</p>

<p>Any ideas on what could be happening?<br />
NOTE: I'm not a Python expert, and i have never used pexpect before, so ANY idea is more than welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>UPDATE: This is definitely related to ssh-copy-id, because with other processes, spawn works well even if they don't return.
Also, apparently ssh-copy-id never returns an EOF.</p>

1653,357656,2010.0,2008-12-10T21:25:18Z,10,Proper way of cancelling accept and closing a Python processing/multiprocessing Listener connection,"<p>(I'm using the <a href=""http://developer.berlios.de/projects/pyprocessing"" rel=""nofollow"">pyprocessing</a> module in this example, but replacing processing with multiprocessing should probably work if you run <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">python 2.6</a> or use the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/"" rel=""nofollow"">multiprocessing backport</a>)</p>

<p>I currently have a program that listens to a unix socket (using a processing.connection.Listener), accept connections and spawns a thread handling the request. At a certain point I want to quit the process gracefully, but since the accept()-call is blocking and I see no way of cancelling it in a nice way. I have one way that works here (OS X) at least, setting a signal handler and signalling the process from another thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>import processing
from processing.connection import Listener
import threading
import time
import os
import signal
import socket
import errno

# This is actually called by the connection handler.
def closeme():
    time.sleep(1)
    print 'Closing socket...'
    listener.close()
    os.kill(processing.currentProcess().getPid(), signal.SIGPIPE)

oldsig = signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, lambda s, f: None)

listener = Listener('/tmp/asdf', 'AF_UNIX')
# This is a thread that handles one already accepted connection, left out for brevity
threading.Thread(target=closeme).start()
print 'Accepting...'
try:
    listener.accept()
except socket.error, e:
    if e.args[0] != errno.EINTR:
        raise
# Cleanup here...
print 'Done...'
</code></pre>

<p>The only other way I've thought about is reaching deep into the connection (listener._listener._socket) and setting the non-blocking option...but that probably has some side effects and is generally really scary.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a more elegant (and perhaps even correct!) way of accomplishing this? It needs to be portable to OS X, Linux and BSD, but Windows portability etc is not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>:
Thanks all! As usual, ambiguities in my original question are revealed :)</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to perform cleanup after I have cancelled the listening, and I don't always want to actually exit that process.</li>
<li>I need to be able to access this process from other processes not spawned from the same parent, which makes Queues unwieldy</li>
<li>The reasons for threads are that:
<ul>
<li>They access a shared state. Actually more or less a common in-memory database, so I suppose it could be done differently.</li>
<li>I must be able to have several connections accepted at the same time, but the actual threads are blocking for something most of the time. Each accepted connection spawns a new thread; this in order to not block all clients on I/O ops.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding threads vs. processes, I use threads for making my blocking ops non-blocking and processes to enable multiprocessing.</p>

The best way I can describe what I want is a lambda function for a class. I have a library that expects as an argument an uninstantiated version of a class to work with. It then instantiates the class itself to work on. The problem is that I'd like to be able to dynamically create versions of the class, to pass to the library, but I can't figure out how to do it since the library expects an uninstantiated version. The code below describes the problem:</p>

<pre><code>class Double:

class Triple:
    def run(self,x):

For example I have cases where u'(2'.  This exists because for formatting reasons the closing paren ends up in an adjacent html cell.  My initial solution to this problem was to look ahead at the contents of the next cell and using a string function determine if it held the closing paren.  I knew this was not a great solution but it worked.  Now I want to fix it but I can't seem to make the regular expression work.   </p>

<p>My understanding of what I think I am doing:<br />
^ at the beginning of the string I want to find<br />
( an open paren, the paren has to be backslashed because it is a special character<br />
\d I also want to find a single digit<br />
[ I am creating a special character class<br />
^ I don't want to find what follows<br />
) which is a close paren<br />
$ at the end of the string  </p>

<p>And of course the plot thickens I made a silly assumption that because I placed a \d I would not find (33 but I am wrong so I added a {1} to my regular expression and that did not help, it matched (3333, so my problem is more complicated than I thought.  I want the string to be only an open paren and a single digit.  Is this the more clever approach </p>

The group should have at least one digit but may have as many as three<br />
The group may have as few as 0 and as many as 1 commas<br />
Following this group there may or may not be a decimal point<br />
If there is a decimal point it will  be followed by as many as 0 but as many as uncounted occurences of digits<br />

The situation is something like this. If I have a db with schema A and it stores data for a feature in say, 5 tables. Schema A -> Schema B is done during an upgrade process.

(Might seem like bad practice from a software-engineering perspective, but I'm usually working with huge datasets which take a while to load into memory.)</p></li>
<li><p>The skeleton-mode support in python.el, which seemed absolutely gratuitous (python's syntax makes such automation unnecessary) and badly designed (for instance, it has no knowledge of ""<code>for</code>"" loop generator expressions or ""<code>&lt;expr 1&gt; if &lt;cond&gt; else &lt;expr 2&gt;</code>"" expressions, so you have to go back and remove the colons it helpfully inserts after insisting that you enter the expression clauses in the minibuffer.)  I couldn't figure out how to turn it off.  There was a <code>python.el</code> variable which claimed to control this, but it didn't seem to work.  It could be that the version of <code>python.el</code> I was using was broken (it came from the debian emacs-snapshot package) so if anyone knows of an up-to-date version of it, I'd like to hear about it.

<p>I'm calling a bunch of methods that return a list.  The list may be empty.  If the list is non-empty, I want to return the first item; otherwise, I want to return None.  This code works:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = get_list()
if len(my_list) &gt; 0: return my_list[0]
return None
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that there should be a simple one-line idiom for doing this, but for the life of me I can't think of it.  Is there?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The reason that I'm looking for a one-line expression here is not that I like incredibly terse code, but because I'm having to write a lot of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>x = get_first_list()
if x:
    # do something with x[0]
    # inevitably forget the [0] part, and have a bug to fix
y = get_second_list()
if y:
    # do something with y[0]
    # inevitably forget the [0] part AGAIN, and have another bug to fix
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd like to be doing can certainly be accomplished with a function (and probably will be):</p>

<pre><code>def first_item(list_or_none):
    if list_or_none: return list_or_none[0]

x = first_item(get_first_list())
if x:
    # do something with x
y = first_item(get_second_list())
if y:
    # do something with y
</code></pre>

<p>I posted the question because I'm frequently surprised by what simple expressions in Python can do, and I thought that writing a function was a silly thing to do if there was a simple expression could do the trick.  But seeing these answers, it seems like a function <em>is</em> the simple solution.</p>

The records I am outputting are usually going to be just a last name, first name, and room code.  I</p>

<p>I would <em>like</em> to output a series of pages, each containing a contiguous subset of the total records, divided into multiple columns, each of which contains a contiguous subset of the total records on the page.  (So in other words, you'd read down the first column, move to the next column, move to the next column, etc., and then start over on the next page...)</p>

<p>The problem I am facing now is that for output formats, I'm almost certainly limited to HTML (and Javascript, CSS, etc.)  What is the best way to get the data into this columnar format?  If I knew for certain that the printable area of the paper would hold 20 records vertically and five horizontally, for instance, I could easily print tables of 5x20, but I don't know if there's a way to indicate a page break -- and I don't know if there's any way to calculate programmatically how many records will fit on the page.</p>

<p>How would you approach this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  The reason I said that I was limited in output:  I have to produce the file on one computer, then bring it to a different computer upon which we cannot install new software and on which the selection of existing software is not optimal.  The file itself is only going to be used to make a physical printout (which is what the end users will actually work with), but my time on the computer that I can print from is going to be limited, so I need to have the file all ready to go and print right away without a lot of tweaking.</p>

<p>Right now I've managed to find a word processor that I can use on the target machine, so I'm going to see if I can target a format that the word processor uses.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Once I knew there was a word processor I could use, I made a simple skeleton file with the settings that I wanted (column and tab settings, monospaced font in a small point size, etc.) and then measured how many characters I got per line of a column and how many lines I got per column.  I've watched the runs pretty carefully to make sure that there weren't some strange lines that somehow overflowed the characters-per-line guideline (which shouldn't happen with monospaced font, of course, but how many times do you end up having to figure out why that thing that ""shouldn't"" happen is happening anyways?)</p>

<p>If there hadn't been a word processor on the target machine that I could use, I probably would have looked at PDF as an output format.</p>

int add(int x, int y) {

    do {
        a = x &amp; y;

    return b;
}

int main( void ){
    printf( ""6 + 3 = %d"", add(6,3));
    printf( ""6 - 3 = %d"", add(6,-3));
    return 0;
}

<p>It works great and I then ported it to Python as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def add(x, y):
    while True:
        a = x &amp; y
        b = x ^ y
        x = a &lt;&lt; 1

        if a == 0:
            break
    return b

print ""6 + 3 = %d"" % add(6,3)
print ""6 - 3 = %d"" % add(6,-3)

<p>They both work for addition and the C program works for subtraction as well.  However, the Python program enters an infinite loop for subtraction.

For instance, if you try saving a string as an IntegerProperty, that will result in an error.</p>

<p>The one exception (no pun intended) is ReferenceProperty. If you have lots of references and you're not completely careful about leaving in bad references, it's common to be greeted with an error like ""TemplateSyntaxError: Caught an exception while rendering: ReferenceProperty failed to be resolved"".</p>

<p>And this is if there's only one bad reference in the view. D'oh. </p>

<p>I could write a try/except block to try to access all the reference properties and delete them if an exception is raised, but this functionality could surely be useful to many other developers if there was a more generic method than the one I'd be capable of writing. I imagine it would take a list of model types and try to access each reference property of each entity in each model, setting the property to None if an exception is raised.</p>

<p>I'll see if I can do this myself, but it would definitely help to have some suggestions/snippets to get me started.</p>

<p>Answer_A and Answer_B are slightly different in that Answer_A also needs a FK relationship to another table. Answer_B may also require some specific attributes later. The problem would STILL exist if I had Answer_B be the superclass - and have Answer_A subclass or compose it.</p>

<p>A 'Risk' is the same whether it's Answer_A or Answer_B. I also have other models that need to reference an 'Answer' regardless of it's sub-type. How can this be done? How can you reference a type regardless of it's sub-type?</p>

<p>Update:<br />
I was trying to avoid a join operation but I don't think I'm going to be able to. Would it be worth having the reference to 'Resident' in all 'Answer's and just nulling it where required? Or is that considered very bad practice? </p>

<p>Here are a few examples of simple functions:</p>

def isPalindrome(inputStr):
    """"""Tests to see if inputStr is the same backwards and forwards.""""""

def sum(nums):

<p>How thoroughly do you check the input values before beginning computation, and how do you do your checking? Do you throw some kind of proprietary exception if input is faulty (BadInputException defined in the same module, for example)? Do you just start your calculation and figure it will throw an exception at some point if bad data was passed in (""asd"" to factorial, for example)?</p>

<p>When the passed in value is supposed to be a container do you check not only the container but all the values inside it?</p>

<p>What about situations like factorial, where what's passed in might be convertible to an int (e.g. a float) but you might lose precision when doing so?</p>

Most recently, I read James Bennett's <a href=""http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/14/packaging/"">On packaging</a> post on why no one should be using setuptools. From my time in #python on Freenode, I know that there are a few souls there who absolutely detest it. I would count myself among them, but I do actually use it.</p>

<p>I've used setuptools for enough projects to be aware of its deficiencies, and I would prefer something better. I don't particularly like the egg format and how it's deployed. With all of setuptools' problems, I haven't found a better alternative.</p>

<p>My understanding of tools like <a href=""http://pip.openplans.org/"">pip</a> is that it's meant to be an easy_install replacement (not setuptools). In fact, pip uses some setuptools components, right?</p>

<p>Most of my packages make use of a setuptools-aware setup.py, which declares all of the dependencies. When they're ready, I'll build an sdist, bdist, and bdist_egg, and upload them to pypi.</p>

<p>If I wanted to switch to using pip, what kind of changes would I need to make to rid myself of easy_install dependencies? Where are the dependencies declared? I'm guessing that I would need to get away from using the egg format, and provide just source distributions. If so, how do i generate the egg-info directories? or do I even need to?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of virtualenv? Doesn't virtualenv use easy_install to manage the environments?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of the setuptools provided ""develop"" command? Should I not use that? What's the alternative?</p>

<p>I'm basically trying to get a picture of what my development workflow will look like.</p>

<p>Before anyone suggests it, I'm not looking for an OS-dependent solution. I'm mainly concerned with debian linux, but deb packages are not an option, for the reasons Ian Bicking outlines <a href=""http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/12/14/a-few-corrections-to-on-packaging/"">here</a>.</p>

Is there anyone who has managed to do it so far, either for the builtin Apache or MAMP.

<p><hr /></p>

<p>After 3 hours of trial and error I've managed to compile mod_wsgi 2.3 for the Apache that comes with Leopard. Here are the instructions in case anyone else needs this.</p>

<ol>
<li>./configure</li>
<li><p>Change 2 lines in the Makefile</p>

<p>CFLAGS =  -Wc,'-arch i386'</p>

<p>LDFLAGS =  -arch i386 -Wl,-F/Library/Frameworks -framework Python -u _PyMac_Error</p></li>

<p>sudo lipo ./httpd.fat -thin i386 -output ./httpd.i386 </p>

<p>sudo ln -s ./httpd.i386 ./httpd</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This should work on intel macbook, macbook pro, imac and mac mini. As I understood the problem is modwsgi won't compile against MacPython 2.5.2 because of some weird architecture missmatch problem. But, if you compile it as a thin binary it won't play with the Apache fat binary. So this hack solves the problem. The rest is pretty standard configuration, like on any other platform.</p>

My OOP classes create new objects (in this case I will need 250,000 new objects, each object is an array of 1,000 doubles) to handle the data.  What is the overhead in terms of memory and computing required in creating objects for a generic OOP language?  In python?  What about in C++?</p>

<p>Yes, I realize I could make a new class that is an array.  But 1) I already have these classes finished and 2) I put each object that I create back into an array for access later anyways.  The question is pedagogical </p>

<p>*update:  I want to be efficient with time, my time and the computers.

1771,375620,34395.0,2008-12-17T18:54:03Z,4,Prevent ftplib from Downloading a File in Progress?,"<p>We have a ftp system setup to monitor/download from remote ftp servers that are not under our control. The script connects to the remote ftp, and grabs the file names of files on the server, we then check to see if its something that has already been downloaded. If it hasn't been downloaded then we download the file and add it to the list.</p>

<p>We recently ran into an issue, where someone on the remote ftp side, will copy in a massive single file(>1GB) then the script will wake up see a new file and begin downloading the file that is being copied in.</p>

<p>What is the best way to check this? I was thinking of grabbing the file size waiting a few seconds checking the file size again and see if it has increased, if it hasn't then we download it. But since time is of the concern, we can't wait a few seconds for every single file set and see if it's file size has increased. </p>

<p>What would be the best way to go about this, currently everything is done via pythons ftplib, how can we do this aside from using the aforementioned method.</p>

<p>Yet again let me reiterate this, we have 0 control over the remote ftp sites.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE1:</p>

<p>I was thinking what if i tried to rename it... since we have full permissions on the ftp, if the file upload is in progress would the rename command fail?</p>

<p>We don't have any real options here... do we?</p>

<p>UPDATE2:
Well here's something interesting some of the ftps we tested on appear to automatically allocate the space once the transfer starts.</p>

<p>E.g. If i transfer a 200mb file to the ftp server. While the transfer is active if i connect to the ftp server and do a size while the upload is happening. It shows 200mb for the size. Even though the file is only like 10% complete.</p>

<p>Permissions also seem to be randomly set the FTP Server that comes with IIS sets the permissions AFTER the file is finished copying. While some of the other older ftp servers set it as soon as you send the file.</p>

User data will exist on a web site, and when the user requests it, that data will need to be injected into an Excel spreadsheet. The complication is that the format of the Excel spreadsheet can vary significantly between users - it'll be user defined.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of this as a templating problem - the excel spreadsheet provides the template, and the task s to inject data into specific user defined cells within that template.</p>

<p>I've looked at xlwt and xlrd for python, as well as jexcelapi and POI-HSSF for Java. They seem like they could work, but given that I simply want to put values into certain cells, they seem like overkill. I'm also worried about re-writing the user's spreadsheet after processing; seems like an opportunity to introduce errors into the process.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell excel to merge the data from one sheet into another? I'm thinking I could produce a simple spreadsheet that has only the data, and somehow get Excel to merge it into the user's existing spreadsheet.</p>

I would like to standardize on something as I seem to be using a few different styles throughout. It seems hard to make asynchronous code simple; I suppose this is because asynchronous operations are anything but.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, the user of the API must be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have data pushed to them as it becomes available
<li>Check the status of the asynchronous operation
<li>Be notified of errors that occur
<li>Wait for completion (converting the asynchronous operation to a synchronous one)
</ol>

<p>My classes support several asynchronous operations. I have been putting some of the status/error callbacks in the class around it, but the class is becoming gunked up with a lot of incidental fields, as well as getting too large. I am curious if anyone has used an asynchronous API they found to be well-organized. I have looked at .NET's Begin/EndAsyncOperation + AsyncResult design, as well as some classes in Java (e.g. Future).</p>

<p>This is being written in Python, so it remains very flexible. There is a caveat: some of these asynchronous operations are being marshaled to a remote machine and executed over there. Thus, not every operation necessarily executes in a separate thread.</p>

This is my first experience with ctypes and the first time I have had to deal with C datatypes in over a year so there is a fair learning curve here, but I think even without that this particular declaration would be troublesome:</p>

<pre><code>extern SANE_Status sane_get_devices (const SANE_Device *** device_list, SANE_Bool local_only);
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, I've successfully dealt with <code>SANE_Status</code> (an enum) and <code>SANE_Bool</code> (a typedef to <code>c_int</code>).  Those were both simple.  That first parameter, on the other hand, is causing me all sorts of grief.  I'm unfamiliar with the ""<code>***</code>"" notation to begin with and my tracer bullets so far have yielded nothing more than garbage data.  How do I format the input to this function such that I can read back a list of my Python structure-objects?  For reference, the C structure being referenced is:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    SANE_String_Const name; /* unique device name */
    SANE_String_Const vendor;   /* device vendor string */
    SANE_String_Const model;    /* device model name */
    SANE_String_Const type; /* device type (e.g., ""flatbed scanner"") */
 }
SANE_Device;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>SANE_String_Const</code> is defined as a <code>c_char_p</code>.</p>

<p>My Python/ctypes version of this object is:</p>

<pre><code>class SANE_Device(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        (""name"", c_char_p),
        (""vendor"", c_char_p),
        (""model"", c_char_p),
        (""type"", c_char_p)]
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions on what I should pass in such that I can get the expected behavior (a list of structure-objects) out of this?  All responses appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>Using the following, I was able to retrieve a correct SANE_Device Python structure:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer(SANE_Device())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents.name
</code></pre>

<p>However, 1) yuck and 2) that seems like it would only work if there is a single result.  I can't len() on <code>devices.contents.contents</code> or <code>devices.contents.contents.contents</code>.  How am I to determine the number of results?  The SANE docs specify that ""If the function executes successfully, it stores a pointer to a NULL terminated array of pointers to SANE_Device structures in *device_list"".  Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>I was able to pass an ten-item array and then access the first element using:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer((SANE_Device * 10)())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents[0].name
</code></pre>

<p>However, ten is obviously an arbitrary number and I have no way of determining the actual number of results.  Trying to access <code>devices.contents.contents.contents[1].name</code> when only one device is connected causes a segmentation fault.  There must be a proper way of dealing with variable-length constructs like these in ctypes.</p>

When we make an HTTP request from the client to the service, one call consistently raises a socket.error in socket.py, in read:</p>

<pre>(104, 'Connection reset by peer')</pre>

<p>When I listen in with wireshark, the ""good"" and ""bad"" responses look very similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because of the size of the OAuth header, the request is split into two packets.  The service responds to both with ACK</li>
<li>The service sends the response, one packet per header (HTTP/1.0 200 OK, then the Date header, etc.).  The client responds to each with ACK.</li>
<li>(Good request) the server sends a FIN, ACK.  The client responds with a FIN, ACK.  The server responds ACK.</li>
<li>(Bad request) the server sends a RST, ACK, the client doesn't send a TCP response, the socket.error is raised on the client side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the web service and the client are running on a Gentoo Linux x86-64 box running glibc-2.6.1.  We're using Python 2.5.2 inside the same virtual_env.</p>

<p>The client is a Django 1.0.2 app that is calling httplib2 0.4.0 to make requests.  We're signing requests with the OAuth signing algorithm, with the OAuth token always set to an empty string.</p>

<p>The service is running Werkzeug 0.3.1, which is using Python's wsgiref.simple_server.  I ran the WSGI app through wsgiref.validator with no issues.</p>

<p>It seems like this should be easy to debug, but when I trace through a good request on the service side, it looks just like the bad request, in the socket._socketobject.close() function, turning delegate methods into dummy methods.  When the send or sendto (can't remember which) method is switched off, the FIN or RST is sent, and the client starts processing.</p>

<p>""Connection reset by peer"" seems to place blame on the service, but I don't trust httplib2 either.  Can the client be at fault?</p>

<p>** Further debugging - Looks like server on Linux **</p>

<p>I have a MacBook, so I tried running the service on one and the client website on the other.  The Linux client calls the OS X server without the bug (FIN ACK).  The OS X client calls the Linux service with the bug (RST ACK, and a (54, 'Connection reset by peer')).  So, it looks like it's the service running on Linux.  Is it x86_64? A bad glibc? wsgiref? Still looking...</p>

<p>** Further testing - wsgiref looks flaky **</p>

<p>We've gone to production with Apache and mod_wsgi, and the connection resets have gone away.  See my answer below, but my advice is to log the connection reset and retry.  This will let your server run OK in development mode, and solidly in production.</p>

<p>Method 2:</p>

<pre><code># steps: 1. validate batch job related data from the request.
#        2. If success, create objects for each request and do the validations.
#        3. If exception, return error found, otherwise, 
#           return a list of pairs with (object, request)
#        4. Do the creation process and email out any errors if encountered.

<p>Pros and Cons as I can see here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Method 1 follows more close to the business logic. No redundant validations check when objects come from db lookup. The validation routines are better maintainable and read.</li>
<li>Method 2 makes easy and clean for the caller. Validations are mandatory even if from db lookup. Validations are less maintainable and read.</li>

I'd say there should be the applications ""users"" and ""questions"". But what if there was a topic system with static articles, too. Maybe they also could receive votes.
How to build the apps structure then? One app for ""questions"", ""votes"" and ""topics"" or just one app ""content""?</p>

<pre><code>  File ""__init__.py"", line 1

<p>I'd like to inform the user that they need to rerun the program with Python >= 2.6 and maybe provide some instructions on how to do so. However, to quote <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0236/"">PEP 236</a>:</p>

  <li>Blank lines.</li>
  <li>Other future_statements.</li>

<p>This snippet from the PEP seems to give hope of doing it inline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q:  I want to wrap future_statements
  in try/except blocks, so I can use
  different code depending on which
  version of Python I'm running.  Why
  can't I?</p>
  
  <p>A:  Sorry!  try/except is a runtime
  feature; future_statements are
  primarily compile-time gimmicks, and
  your try/except happens long after the
  compiler is done.  That is, by the
  time you do try/except, the semantics
  in effect for the module are already a
  done deal.  Since the try/except
  wouldn't accomplish what it <em>looks</em>
  like it should accomplish, it's simply
  not allowed.  We also want to keep
  these special statements very easy to
  find and to recognize.</p>
  
  <p>Note that you <em>can</em> import __future__
  directly, and use the information in
  it, along with sys.version_info, to
  figure out where the release you're
  running under stands in relation to a
  given feature's status.</p>

In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b

<p>I am of the mind that you almost never need to use metaclasses. Why? because I figure if you are doing something like that to a class, you should probably be doing it to an object. And a small redesign/refactor is in order.</p>

<p>Being able to use metaclasses has caused a lot of people in a lot of places to use classes as some kind of second rate object, which just seems disastrous to me. Is programming to be replaced by meta-programming? The addition of class decorators has unfortunately made it even more acceptable.</p>

<p>So please, I am desperate to know your valid (concrete) use-cases for metaclasses in Python. Or to be enlightened as to why mutating classes is better than mutating objects, sometimes.</p>

I dabbled in python, but realized that it would just be too much trouble since it doesn't spawn threads across cores (meaning an 8 core server=1 core server). I also didn't really like the language (that ""self"" stuff grossed me out).</p>

<p>I know that C++ is the language for the job in terms of performance, but I hate it. I don't want to deal with its sloppy syntax and I like my hand to be held by managed languages. This brings me to C# and Java, but I am open to other languages. I love the simplicity of .NET, but I was wondering if, speed wise, this would be good for the job. Keep in mind since this will be deployed on a Linux server, it would be running on the Mono framework - not sure if that matters. I know that Java is syntax-wise very similar to .Net, but my experience with it is limited. Are there any frameworks out there for it or anthing to ease in the development?</p>

<p>Please help me and my picky self arrive on a solution.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I didn't mean to sound so picky, and I really don't think I was. The only language I really excluded was C++, Python I don't like because of the scalability problem. I know that there are ways of communicating between processes, but if I have an 8 core server, why should I need to make 8 processes? Is there a more elegant solution?</p>

Once every second, my program starts a new thread that fetches some data from the web, and stores this data to my hard drive. I would like to use sqlite3 to store these results, but I can't get it to work. The issue seems to be about the following line:</p>

<pre><code>conn = sqlite3.connect(""mydatabase.db"")
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If I put this line of code inside each thread, I get an OperationalError telling me that the database file is locked. I guess this means that another thread has mydatabase.db open through a sqlite3 connection and has locked it.</li>
<li>If I put this line of code in the main program and pass the connection object (conn) to each thread, I get a ProgrammingError, saying that SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously I was storing all my results in CSV files, and did not have any of these file-locking issues. Hopefully this will be possible with sqlite. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm trying to pass data to subprocess.Popen().  The process will read from stdin, but you cannot pass a ""file-like"" object to Popen because it calls stdin.fileno() and blows up unless you have a real file.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to pass the PIPE argument to Popen, which allows you to use proc.stdin as a file-like object.  But if you've already got a file-like object, there doesn't seem to be a great way to yolk the two of them together.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone here have already managed to find a workaround.</p>

<p>The problem is that due to the new changes in Python 3.0 regarding bytes and strings, not all the library code is apparently tested.</p>

<p>I have a script that downloades a page from a web server. This script passed a username and password as part of the url in python 2.6, but in Python 3.0, this doesn't work any more.</p>

<p>For instance, this:</p>

<p>Apparently, base64-encoding now needs bytes in and outputs a string, and thus urlretrieve (or some code therein) which builds up a string of username:password, and tries to base64-encode this for simple authorization, fails.</p>

<p>If I instead try to use urlopen, like this:</p>

Or how do I learn about being a web developer using OS X?,"<p>I'm new to the Mac OS X, and I'm just about ready to throw my brand new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro"" rel=""nofollow"">MacBook Pro</a> out the window. Every tutorial on setting up a Django development environment on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Leopard"" rel=""nofollow"">Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X Leopard</a> is insidiously wrong. They are all skipping over one step, or assuming you have setup something one way, or are just assuming that I know one thing that I must not.</p>

<p>I'm very familiar with how to setup the environment on Ubuntu/Linux, and the only part I'm getting stuck on with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X"" rel=""nofollow"">OS&nbsp;X</a> is how to install MySQL, autostart it, and install the Python MySQL bindings. I think my mistake was using a hodgepodge of tools I don't fully understand; I used fink to install MySQL and its development libraries and then tried to build the Python-MySQL bindings from source (but they won't build.)</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I installed the binary MySQL package from <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg</a>, and I got MySQL server running (can access with admin.)
The MySQL version I got from port was rubbish, I could not get it to run at all.</p>

<p>I modified the source for the Python-MySQL package as per the answer I chose, but I still got compilation errors that I listed in the comments. I was able to fix these by adding /usr/local/mysql/bin/ to my path in my ""~/.profile"" file.
""
PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH
""</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I was very wary about editing the source code since this operation had been so easy on Ubuntu, but I'll be more willing to try that in the future. I'm really missing Ubuntu's ""apt-get"" command; it makes life very easy and simple sometimes. I already have an Ubuntu <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware"" rel=""nofollow"">VMware</a> image running on my Mac, so I can always use that as a fallback (plus it more closely matches my production machines so should be a good test environment for debugging production problems.)</p>

1886,396455,,2008-12-28T17:51:48Z,6,Python-PostgreSQL psycopg2 interface --> executemany,"<p>I am currently analyzing a wikipedia dump file; I am extracting a bunch of data from it using python and persisting it into a PostgreSQL db. I am always trying to make things go faster for this file is huge (18GB). In order to interface with PostgreSQL, I am using psycopg2, but this module seems to mimic many other such DBAPIs.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a question concerning cursor.executemany(command, values); it seems to me like executing an executemany once every 1000 values or so is better than calling cursor.execute(command % value) for each of these 5 million values (please confirm or correct me!).</p>

<p>But, you see, I am using an executemany to INSERT 1000 rows into a table which has a UNIQUE integrity constraint; this constraint is not verified in python beforehand, for this would either require me to SELECT all the time (this seems counter productive) or require me to get more than 3 GB of RAM. All this to say that I count on Postgres to warn me when my script tried to INSERT an already existing row via catching the psycopg2.DatabaseError. </p>

<p>When my script detects such a non-UNIQUE INSERT, it connection.rollback() (which makes ups to 1000 rows everytime, and kind of makes the executemany worthless) and then INSERTs all values one by one.</p>

<p>Since psycopg2 is so poorly documented (as are so many great modules...), I cannot find an efficient and effective workaround. I have reduced the number of values INSERTed per executemany from 1000 to 100 in order to reduce the likeliness of a non-UNIQUE INSERT per executemany, but I am pretty certain their is a way to just tell psycopg2 to ignore these execeptions or to tell the cursor to continue the executemany. </p>

<p>Basically, this seems like the kind of problem which has a solution so easy and popular, that all I can do is ask in order to learn about it.</p>

Many of the tools I build have simple windowed GUIs for the animators and modellers to use.  These GUIs often contain what you'd normally expect to see in any basic window; labels, lists, menus, buttons, textfields, etc.  However, there are limitations to the complexity of the UIs you can build with the available tools, specifically in the types of available widgets.</p>

<p>I'm interested in using some of the more advanced wxPython widgets such as the ListView (grid), Tree, etc.  This would involve using a complete wxFrame (window) to display the whole UI, which would essentially mean that window would no longer be tied to Maya.  Not a deal breaker, but it means when Maya is minimized, the window won't follow suit.</p>

<p>I've tried something like this before with tkinter as a test, but found that it needed a MainLoop to run in its own thread.  This is logical, but in my case, it conflicts with Maya's own thread, essentially making Maya hang until the window is closed.  This is due to the fact that Maya runs all scripts, be they MEL or Python, in a single thread that the main Maya GUI shares.  This is to prevent one script from, say, deleting an object while another script is trying to do work on the same object.</p>

<p>In python, you can index lists using slice notation. Here's an example:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5:2]
[0, 2, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>The stride is also allowed to be negative, meaning the elements are retrieved in reverse order:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[5:0:-1]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But wait!  I wanted to see <code>[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]</code>.  Oh, I see, I need to decrement the start and end indices:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4:-1:-1]
[]
</code></pre>

<p>What happened?  It's interpreting -1 as  being at the end of the array, not the beginning.  I know you can achieve this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"">PEP 8</a> is the <em>Style Guide for Python Code</em>. It contains the conventions all python programmers should follow.</li>
<li><a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8"">pep8.py</a> is a (very useful) script that checks the code formating of a given python script, according to PEP 8.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/"">Eclipse</a> is a great IDE. With the <a href=""http://pydev.sourceforge.net/"">Pydev</a> extension, it that can be used to develop Python</li>

<p>I run pep8.py manually when I'm scripting, but with bigger projects I prefer to use Eclipse.
It would be really useful to integrate pep8.py in Eclipse/Pydev, so it can be run automatically in all the files in the project, and point to the lines containing the warnings.
Maybe there is an obvious way to do it, but I haven't found it yet.</p>

I'm creating a simple database based on dictionaries which holds all the components and their properties.  I'm also trying to create a simple query language where you can select, for example, all resistors with value>100ohms or footprint='0402'  </p>

<p>So far, I can select things using some primitive predicate search and then union and intersection for more complex things.  </p>

<p>However, I'm having trouble defining what the semantics ought to be for a purely negative search.  For instance, something like   </p>

<p>footprint != '0402'   </p>

<p>should select all items with footprint not equal to 0402.  But doing this with only intersection gives me a blank result.  For this to work I need to select <em>all</em> components, then intersect with ""not 0402"" to remove the ones I don't want.</p>

<p>But this seems kind of brute force and seems like a fishy solution.  I'm not interested in using a ""real"" database and query language, so please don't suggest that.  I'm looking for the proper engineering rationale here, not necessarily a workaround to the problem.</p>

<p>This problem was covered to some degree in SICP book, but I got very confused, since I think they were also using continuations and stuff, which I don't get yet.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain what the 'proper' usage ought to be for negatively selecting stuff.  I tried this in a commercial cad tool and it worked as expected, but then I've seen some SQL query examples (I think), which selected things <em>first</em>, then removed the unwanted ones.</p>

So I have this .py file that reads like:</p>

<pre><code>starting_length=9
starting_cell_size=1000
LengthofExperiments=5000000
</code></pre>

<p>Then I execute the file and get the data. Since the program is all on my machine and no one else has access to it, it is secure in a trivial way.<br>
I can also write a similar file very easily:</p>

<pre><code>def writeoptions(directory):
    options=""""
    options+=""starting_length=%s%s""%(starting_length,os.linesep)
    options+=""starting_cell_size=%s%s""%(starting_cell_size,os.linesep)
    options+=""LengthofExperiments=%s%s""%(LengthofExperiments,os.linesep)
...
    open(""%s%soptions.py""%(directory,os.sep),'w').write(options)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to pass a function as one of the parameters:</p>

<pre><code>starting_length=9
starting_cell_size=1000
LengthofExperiments=5000000

def pippo(a,b):
    return a+b
functionoperator=pippo
</code></pre>

<p>And of course in the real experiment the function pippo will be much more complex. And different from experiment to experiment.</p>

<p>But what I am unable to do is to write the function automatically. In short I don't know how to generalise the writeoptions function to keep on writing the options, if one of the options is a function. I could of course copy the original file, but this is inelegant, inefficient (because it contains a lot of extra options that are not being used), and generally does not solve the question.</p>

<p>How do you get python to write down the code of a function, as it writes down the value of a variable?</p>

Each category has a ""parent"" ForeignKey pointing back to the same Category model.  I want to allow admins to add categories, and I want the interface to allow them to select a category's parent category.  However, I want to avoid I'm-my-own-grandpa situations, so I want to limit the available choices of categories to those which do not have category in question as an ancestor.</p>

<p>where instance is the category being edited and getHierarchy() is a method to get a list of ancestor ids.</p>

1911,401215,38140.0,2008-12-30T19:30:11Z,9,How to limit rate of requests to web services in Python?,"<p>I'm working on a Python library that interfaces with a web service API. Like many web services I've encountered, this one requests limiting the rate of requests. I would like to provide an optional parameter, <code>limit</code>, to the class instantiation that, if provided, will hold outgoing requests until the number of seconds specified passes.</p>

<p>I understand that the general scenario is the following: an instance of the class makes a request via a method. When it does, the method emits some signal that sets a lock variable somewhere, and begins a countdown timer for the number of seconds in <code>limit</code>. (In all likelihood, the lock is the countdown timer itself.) If another request is made within this time frame, it must be queued until the countdown timer reaches zero and the lock is disengaged; at this point, the oldest request on the queue is sent, and the countdown timer is reset and the lock is re-engaged.</p>

<p>Is this a case for threading? Is there another approach I'm not seeing?</p>

<p>Should the countdown timer and lock be instance variables, or should they belong to the class, such that all instances of the class hold requests?</p>

<p>Also, is this generally a bad idea to provide rate-limiting functionality within a library? I reason since, by default, the countdown is zero seconds, the library still allows developers to use the library and provide their own rate-limiting schemes. Given any developers using the service will need to rate-limit requests anyway, however, I figure that it would be a convenience for the library to provide a means of rate-limiting.</p>

<p>Regardless of placing a rate-limiting scheme in the library or not, I'll want to write an application using the library, so suggested techniques will come in handy.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your suggestions!</p>

I then have another table - shop which acts like a shop,containing loads of products and their barcodes.some of the products in the shop table are in the stock table at the moment, and there is a boolenan field called stock which tells us if that product is in the stock table or not, if its equal to 1, it is in the fridge, if it is equal to 0, it is not in the fridge. Two fields in the stocks table are amount and quantity. The amount is what is in the fridge at the moment, the quantity is what has to be in the fridge at all times. When something is taken out of the fridge, that product's amount amount drops by 1.  Each barcode in the stocks table has a matching one in the shop table. I need to make a query to the database from a python program which will order products from the shops table when the amount (whats in the fridge) is less than the quantity (whats meant to be in the fridge at all times).

I have realised that the reason I'm asking so many questions may not be because I'm so new to Python (but I know a good bit of PHP) and is probably not because Python has some inherent flaw.</p>

<p>Thus I will now say what the project is and what my current idea is and you can either tell me I'm doing it all wrong, that there's a few things I need to learn or that Python is simply not suited to dealing with this type of project and language XYZ would be better in this instance or even that there's some open source project I might want to get involved in.</p>

<p><strong>The project</strong><br>
I run a free turn based strategy game (think the campaign mode from the total war series but with even more complexity and depth) and am creating a combat simulator for it (again, think total war as an idea of how it'd work). I'm in no way deluded enough to think that I'll ever make anything as good as the Total war games alone but I do think that I can automate a process that I currently do by hand.</p>

<p><strong>What will it do</strong><br>
It will have to take into account a large range of variables for the units, equipment, training, weather, terrain and so on and so forth. I'm aware it's a big task and I plan to do it a piece at a time in my free time. I've zero budget but it's a hobby that I'm prepared to put time into (and have already).</p>

<p><strong>My current stumbling block</strong><br>
In PHP everything can access everything else, ""wrong"" though some might consider this it's really really handy for this. If I have an array of equipment for use by the units, I can get hold of that array from anywhere. With Python I have to remake that array each time I import the relevant data file and this seems quite a silly solution for a language that from my experience is well thought out. I've put in a system of logging function calls and class creation (because I know from a very basic version of this that I did in PHP once that it'll help a lot down the line) and the way that I've kept the data in one place is to pass each of my classes an instance to my logging list, smells like a hack to me but it's the only way I've gotten it to work.</p>

<p>Thus I conclude I'm missing something and would very much appreciate the insight of anybody willing to give it. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Code samples</strong></p>

<p>This creates a list of formations, so far there's only one value (besides the name) but I anticipate adding more on which is why they're a list of classes rather than just a standard list. This is found within data.py</p>

<pre><code>formations = []
formationsHash = []
def createFormations(logger):
	""""""This creates all the formations that will be used""""""

	# Standard close quarter formation, maximum number of people per square metre
	formationsHash.append('Tight')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Tight', tightness = 1))

	# Standard ranged combat formation, good people per square metre but not too cramped
	formationsHash.append('Loose')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Loose', tightness = 0.5))

	# Standard skirmishing formation, very good for moving around terrain and avoiding missile fire
	formationsHash.append('Skirmish')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Skirmish', tightness = 0.1))

	# Very unflexible but good for charges
	formationsHash.append('Arrowhead')
	formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Arrowhead', tightness = 1))


def getFormation(searchFor):
	""""""Returns the fomation object with this name""""""
	indexValue = formationsHash.index(searchFor)
	return formations[indexValue]
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have a code sample of when I'd need to access it because I've not gotten as far as making it but I anticipate the code looking something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Python
tempFormation = data.getFormation(unit.formationType)
tempTerrain = data.getTerrain(unit.currentTerrain)
unit.attackDamage = unit.attackDamage * tempTerrain.tighnessBonus(tempFormation.tightness)
</code></pre>

<p>The unit contains an integer that links to the index/key of the relevant terrain, formation and whatnot in the master list. Temporary variables are used to make the 3rd line shorter but in the long run will possibly cause issues if I forget to get one and it's use a value from earlier which is then incorrect (that's where the logging comes in handy). </p>

<pre><code>PHP
$unit-&gt;attackDamage *= $terrain[$unit-&gt;currentTerrain]-&gt;tighnessBonus($unit-&gt;currentTerrain)
</code></pre>

<p>The unit class contains the index (probably a string) of the relevant terrain it's on and the formation it's in.</p>

<p>Maybe this will show some massive flaw in my understanding of Python (6 months vs the 3 years of PHP).</p>

<p>Besides formatting, the user must be able to use placeholders for a couple of variables that would get replaced at runtime. </p>

<p>The way this is currently working is very simple: the templates have the Pythonic %(var)s placeholders and I replace those with a dictionary before applying Markdown2 formatting.</p>

<p>Turns out that the end user of this system will be a tech-savvy user and I wouldn't like to make it obvious to everyone that it's written in Python. </p>

<p>It's not that I don't like Python... I actually think Python is the perfect tool for the job, I just don't want to expose that to the user (would like the same even if it were written in Java, Perl, Ruby or anything else).</p>

<p>So I'd like to ask for insights on what would be, in your opinion, the best way to expose placeholders for the users:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What do you think is the best placeholder format (thinks like ${var}, $(var) or #{var})?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be the best way to replace those placeholders?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I though of using a Regular Expression to change - for instance - ${var} into %(var)s and then applying the regular Python templating substitution, but I am not sure that's the best approach.</p>

<p>If you go that way, it would be very nice if you could indicate me what is a draft of that regular expression as well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: An user pointed out using full-blown templating systems, but I think that may not be worth it, since all I need is placeholders substitution: I won't have loops or anything like that.</p>

<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: I have chosen not to use any template engines at this time. I chose to go with the simpler string.Template approach (as pointed out on a comment by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/49032/hyperboreean"">hyperboreean</a>). Truth is that I don't like to pick a solution because sometime in the future there may be a need. I will keep all those suggestions on my sleeve, and if on the lifespan of the application there is a clear need for one or more features offered by them, I'll revisit the idea. Right now, I really think it's an overkill. Having full blown templates that <strong>the end user</strong> can edit as he wants is, at least on my point of view, more trouble than benefit. Nevertheless, it feels much nicer being aware of the reasons I did not went down that path, than just not researching anything and choosing it. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for all the input.</p>

<p>I look at the contact summary (without opening it) and the category is unchanged (not refreshed?). </p>

<p>I open the contact and its category HAS changed, <em>sometimes</em>. (Not sure of when, but it feels like it is cache related.) If it has changed, it prompts me to Save Changes when I close it which is odd, because I haven't changed anything in the Outlook UI.</p>

<p>If I quit and restart Outlook, the changes are gone.</p>

<p>I <em>suspect</em> I am failing to call <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842181.aspx"">SaveChanges</a>, but I can't see which object supports it.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I be calling SaveChanges? If so, where is it?</li>
<li>Am I making some other silly mistake, which is causing my data to be discarded?</li>

<p><a href=""http://tomayko.com/writings/no-rails-for-python"">This article from 2005</a> talks about the lack of a single, central framework for Python. For Ruby, this framework is clearly Rails. <strong>Why, historically speaking, did this happen for Ruby but not for Python?</strong> (or did it happen, and that framework is Django?)</p>

<p>Also, the hypothetical questions: <strong>would Python be more popular if it had one, good framework? Would Ruby be less popular if it had no central framework?</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Please avoid discussions of whether Ruby or Python is better, which is just too open-ended to answer.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Though I thought this is obvious, I'm not saying that other frameworks do not exist for Ruby, but rather that the big one <strong>in terms of popularity</strong> is Rails. Also, I should mention that I'm not saying that frameworks for Python are not as good (or better than) Rails. Every framework has its pros and cons, but Rails seems to, as Ben Blank says in the one of the comments below, have surpassed Ruby in terms of popularity. There are no examples of that on the Python side. WHY? That's the question.</p>

1950,407464,,2009-01-02T17:22:29Z,1,How to synchronize the same object on client and server side in client-server application? Is small messages framework good for this job?,"<p>I'm making a game engine in c++ and python. I'm using OGRE for 3D rendering, OpenAL for sound, ODE for physics, OIS for input, HawkNL for networking and boost.python for embedded python interpreter. Every subsystem (library) is wrapped by a class - manager and every manager is singleton. Now, I have a class - Object - this could be every visible object in game world. This is some kind of mix, object has graphics representation (entity) and representation in physics simulator (solid). These two are most important here. Class Object is just pure abstract base class - interface. I've decided to implement Object on client side as ObjectClientSide - this implementation has the entity, and on server side as ObjectServerSide - this implementation has the solid. Physics simulator runs only on server, and rendering is done only on client of course. The object can exist only when both implementations are working together. Every object has unique id and both instances of the same object on client and server side have the same id.</p>

<p>So, after this short background, my first question is: is this design good? How can I make it better? And the main question: how should I synchronize these objects?</p>

<p>Next, both implementations have the same interface, but part of it is implemented on server side and part on client side. So, for example, if player wants to move forward his character he should send a request to object on server. The server then makes changes to simulation and sends updated position to client. For that reason, I've created small messages framework. There is a Message class, Router, Rule and rules inherited from Rule. When message arrives, Router checks it against the rules and sends it to destination. So, when I call myObjectInstanceOnClientSide->setPosition(x,y,z) this object creates Message, its content is function and parameters and destination is object with the same id on server. When object with the same id on server side gets this message it calls this function with given arguments. So, when a function can't be implemented on one side it creates a message and sends it to object on the other side. I think this can be very useful in scripts. Scripts can be very clean, if script needs for example turn on animation on clients, I only need to call this function on server's local object - the rest is in background.</p>

<p>So, is this ok? Am I wrong about this? It this common solution?</p>

<p>When I right click a file, choose Send To, and select Aquate (my python), it opens a command prompt for a split second and then closes it. Nothing gets uploaded.</p>

<p>I knew there was probably an error going on so I typed the code into CL python, line by line.

<p>I need to be able to catch unhandled exceptions during my mainloop so that I can further handle them and display them in error dialogs, not pass silently, and not terminate the app.</p>

<p>The sys.excepthook solution is too low level and doesn't play nice with the wxPython mainloop thread.  While the link to the other answer does the same try/except wrapping around the mainloop which doesn't work due, once again, to wxPython spawning a different thread for the app/ui.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of mailboxes in Maildir format (a backup from the mail server on my old web host), and I need to extract the emails from these. 
So far, the simplest way I've found has been to convert them to the mbox format, which Thunderbird supports, and it seems Python has a few classes for reading/writing both formats. Seems perfect.</p>

<p>The Python docs even have this little code snippet doing exactly what I need:</p>

<pre><code>src = mailbox.Maildir('maildir', factory=None)
dest = mailbox.mbox('/tmp/mbox')

for msg in src:   #1
    dest.add(msg) #2
</code></pre>

<p><em>Except</em> it doesn't work. And here's where my complete lack of knowledge about Python sets in.
On a few messages, I get a UnicodeDecodeError during the iteration (that is, when it's trying to read <code>msg</code> from <code>src</code>, on line <code>#1</code>). On others, I get a UnicodeEncodeError when trying to add <code>msg</code> to <code>dest</code> (line <code>#2</code>).</p>

<p>Clearly it makes some wrong assumptions about the encoding used. But I have no clue how to specify an encoding on the mailbox (For that matter, I don't know what the encoding should be either, but I can probably figure that out once I find a way to actually specify an encoding). </p>

<p>I get stack traces similar to the following:</p>

The communication is assumed to occur over a local network (wired or wireless). It has to be highly secure, of course.</p>

<p>The best I could come up with is to write a Python REST web service and connect to it through the Cocoa app. Maybe I'll even use Python to code the Cocoa app itself.</p>

<p>The Django model class provides a simple method <em>get</em> which allows me to search for <em>one and only one</em> object from the database, if it finds more or less it raises an exception. If can find zero or more with an alternative <em>filter</em> method, which returns a list:</p>

<pre><code>objects = ModelClass.objects.filter(search=value)
if len(objects) == 1:
    object = objects[0]

I'd much prefer a function that returns <em>None</em> on failure. Would I be better to use Django's <em>filter</em> method and process the list myself?</p>

@Gerald, Thanks for the code. I initially thought this is some obfuscation of the id. 
But, it is just doing the conversion from integer to a more compact representation. I am thinking, why is this being done? why not use the original integer itself!!</p>

<p>I've decided on wxPython for the actual window since I'm fairly familiar with it already.  However, I need to produce an OpenGL viewport that can respond to the various mouse events.  It wouldn't hurt to have some convenience math in place for converting the 2D mouse positions in ""camera space"" into world space coordinates to make selection tasks easier.</p>

<p>I'm looking for recommendations on which modules I should be looking at.</p>

<p>The specific application is this:</p>

<p>A user can upload as many pictures as they want on the image upload form. Once the pictures are uploaded they are taken to a page where they can give the pictures a name and description. The number of pictures will depend on how many the user has chosen to upload.</p>

<p>So <strong>how do I get django to generate a form using a variable number of input fields</strong> (which could be passed as an argument if necessary)?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> a few things have changed since the <a href=""http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/nov/09/dynamic-forms/"">article mentioned in jeff bauer's answer</a> was written. </p>

<p>Namely this line of code which doesn't seem to work:</p>

<pre><code># BAD CODE DO NOT USE!!!
return type('ContactForm', [forms.BaseForm], { 'base_fields': fields })
</code></pre>

<p>So here is what I came up with...</p>

<h1>The Answer I used:</h1>

<pre><code>
from tagging.forms import TagField
from django import forms

def make_tagPhotos_form(photoIdList):
    ""Expects a LIST of photo objects (ie. photo_sharing.models.photo)""

    fields = {}

    for id in photoIdList:
    	id = str(id)

    	fields[id+'_name'] = forms.CharField()
    	fields[id+'_tags'] = TagField()
    	fields[id+'_description'] = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    return type('tagPhotos', (forms.BaseForm,), { 'base_fields': fields })

par1 = SingleParameter(name='par1', default_value=10, unit='mV')
par2 = SingleParameter(name='par2', default_value=20, unit='mA')

    # now comes the part that I don't know how to implement with property():
    # It shoule be something like
    # self.__dict__[parameter.name] = property(...) ?

col = Collection()
col.add(par1)
col.add(par2)
col['par1'] # gives the whole object

# Now here is what I would like to get:
# col.par1 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v

I realize that I could just use <code>default=datetime.datetime.utcnow</code>; however, this is a naive time that would happily accept someone passing in a naive localtime-based datetime, even if I used <code>timezone=True</code> with it, because it makes local or UTC time non-naive without having a base timezone to normailze it with.

1998,415019,52302.0,2009-01-06T00:16:30Z,5,can cherrypy receive multipart/mixed POSTs out of the box?,"<p>We're receiving some POST data of xml + arbitrary binary files (like images and audio) from a device that only gives us multipart/mixed encoding.</p>

<p>I've setup a cherrypy upload/POST handler for our receiver end.  I've managed to allow it to do arbitrary number of parameters using multipart/form-data.  However when we try to send the multipart-mixed data, we're not getting any processing.</p>

<pre><code>@cherrypy.expose
def upload(self, *args,**kwargs):
    """"""upload adapted from cherrypy tutorials

    We use our variation of cgi.FieldStorage to parse the MIME
    encoded HTML form data containing the file.""""""

    print args   
    print kwargs

    cherrypy.response.timeout = 1300

    lcHDRS = {}
    for key, val in cherrypy.request.headers.iteritems():
        lcHDRS[key.lower()] = val
    incomingBytes = int(lcHDRS['content-length'])

    print cherrypy.request.rfile 

    #etc..etc...
</code></pre>

<p>So, when submitting multipart/form-data, args and kwargs are well defined.<br />
args are the form fields, kwargs=hash of vars and values.
When I submit multipart/mixed, args and kwargs are empty, and I just have cherrypy.request.rfile as the raw POST information.  </p>

<p>My question is, does cherrypy have a built in handler to handle multipart/mixed and chunked encoding for POST?  Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p>

<p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>...to clarify</p>

<p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p>

<p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p>

<p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p>

<p>In that example, I get:</p>

<pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] 
kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p>

<p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p>

<pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
content-language:en-US
content-length:565719
mime-version:1.0
content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'
host:192.168.1.1:8180
transfer-encoding:chunked



--newdivider
Content-type: text/xml

&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;Stuff&gt;....
etc...etc...

--newdivider
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpg
Content-transfer-encoding: binary

&lt;binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>

1999,415407,2128.0,2009-01-06T04:01:41Z,3,Why does gethostbyaddr(gethostname()) return my IPv6 IP?,"<p>I'm working on making a simple server application with python, and I'm trying to get the IP to bind the listening socket to. An example I looked at uses this: </p>

<pre><code>HOST = gethostbyaddr(gethostname())
</code></pre>

<p>With a little more processing after this, it should give me just the host IP as a string. This should return the IPv4 address. But when I run this code, it returns my IPv6 address. Why does it do this and how can I get my IPv4 address?</p>

<p>If its relevant, I'm using windows vista and python 2.5</p>
